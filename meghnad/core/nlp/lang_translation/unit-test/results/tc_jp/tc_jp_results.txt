 ['It is the most populous country in the world, with a population of about 1.4 billion in 2019. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers (3.7 million miles), it is the third or fourth largest country in the world in terms of area. The states governed by the Communist Party of China have jurisdiction over 22 states, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing), and special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. China has emerged as one of the world's first civilizations in the fertile watershed of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For thousands of years, China's political system was based on a hereditary monarchy or dynasty that began with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in the 21st century BC. Since then, China has expanded, collapsed, and reunified many times. In the 3rd century BC, Qin reunited with core China and established the first Chinese empire. After reigning from 206 BC to 220 AD, the Han dynasty saw some of the cutting-edge technologies of the time, such as papermaking, compasses, agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder and type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song (960–1127) completed four great inventions. The Tang culture spread throughout Asia as the new Silk Road took traders to the corners of Mesopotamia and Africa. The reign of the dynasty ended in 1912 with the Yin Metal Pig, and the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty. Due to the subsequent Chinese Communist War, the Chinese Communist Party led by Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in mainland China in 1949, and the Kuomintang government led by the Kuomintang withdrew to Taiwan Island and ruled until 1996. When Taiwan transitioned to democracy. Taiwan's political status continues to be contested to this day. China is a single one-party socialist republic and one of the few existing socialist countries. Political opponents and human rights groups have accused and criticized the Chinese government for widespread human rights violations, including repression of religious and ethnic minorities, censorship and mass surveillance, and crackdowns on protests such as 1989. The Chinese government states that the right to survival and economic development is a prerequisite for other types of human rights, and that the concept of human rights should take into account the country's current economic level. Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China's economy has been one of the fastest growing countries in the world, with annual growth consistently above 6%. According to the World Bank, China's GDP has increased from $ 150 billion in 1978 to $ 1224 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion yuan ($ 135 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's second largest economy in terms of nominal GDP, and since 2014, it has become the world's largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity. China is also the world's largest exporter and the second largest importer of commodities. China is recognized as a nuclear-weapon state and has the world's largest standing army, the PLA, and the second largest defense budget. The PRC is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, which replaced the ROC in 1971, and is an active global partner of the ASEAN Plus Mechanism. China has been characterized as an emerging superpower, primarily due to its large population, large and fast-growing economy, and strong army. The word "China" has been used in English since the 16th century. But that was not the word the Chinese themselves used during that period. Its origins date from Portuguese, Malay, Persian to Sanskrit, which was used in ancient India. "China" appears in the 1555 translation of Richard Eden in the 1516 journal of Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa. The usage of Barbosa is derived from Persian (چ0064ن), and Persian is derived from Sanskrit (चीन). First used in early Hindu scriptures, including (5th century) and (2nd century). In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China was ultimately derived from the name of the Qin dynasty (221-206 BC). This derivative is still available from a variety of sources, but the origin of Sanskrit is controversial. Alternatives include the names of Yelan and Jin or Chu. The official name of the modern nation is "Pinyin" (Chinese: People's Republic of China; Pinyin :). The short form is "China" from ("central") and ("state"), a term developed in connection with the royal territory under the Western Zhou dynasty. It was then applied around Luoyang (now Luoyang) in the eastern Zhou, then applied to the Central Plains of China, and then used as an occasional synonym for the provinces under Qing. It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the perceived "barbarians" from the Huaxia. The name has also been translated into English. Archaeological evidence suggests that early apes inhabited China 2.24 million to 250,000 years ago. A fire-based fossil of a Peking Man ape was found in the Zhoukou Dian Cave near Beijing. They date back 680,000 to 780,000 years. Fossilized teeth (125,000-80,000 years ago) were found in the Fengyan Cave in Dao County, Hunan Province. The original Chinese characters were around 7,000 in Jiahu, around 6000 in Damaidi, around 5800-5400 in the old officials, and in the Banpo ruins in the 5th millennium. Some scholars suggest that the Jiahu symbol (7000 BC) constitutes the earliest Chinese secretary system. According to Chinese tradition, the first dynasty was Xia, which emerged around 2100. The Xia dynasty marked the beginning of a hereditary monarchy, a dynasty-based political system in China, which lasted for thousands of years. The dynasty was considered a myth by historians until 1959, when scientific excavations discovered early Bronze Age ruins in Yanshi Erlitou, Henan Province. It is unclear whether these sites are the ruins of the Xia dynasty or the ruins of another culture of the same period. The successor, the Shang dynasty, is the earliest confirmed by contemporary records. Yin dominated the plains of the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th centuries. Their Oracle Bone Script (from) represents the oldest form of Chinese characters found so far and is a direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters. The Shang dynasty was conquered during the reign of the 11th and 5th centuries, but centralization was gradually eroded by feudal warlords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou, completely disobeying Zhou, and continued to war with each other during the Spring and Autumn period of 300. By the Warring States period of the 5th and 3rd centuries, only seven powerful states remained. The Warring States period ended in 221 after Qin conquered the other six kingdoms, reunified China, and established a dictatorship. Qin Shi Huang declared himself the first emperor of the Qin dynasty. He enacted Qin's lawyer reforms across China. In particular, the compulsory standardization of Chinese characters, dimensions, road widths (that is, cart axle lengths), and currencies. His dynasty also conquered the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangdong Province, and the Yue tribe of Vietnam. The Qin dynasty lasted only 15 years and collapsed shortly after the death of Qin Shi Huang. His strict authoritarian policies have caused widespread rebellion. After the widespread civil war that burned down the Imperial Library of the Han Dynasty, the Han dynasty ruled China between 206 and 220, and was culturally among the people still remembered by the Han Chinese name. Created an identity. The Han Chinese greatly expanded the territory of the empire, military operations were carried out in Central Asia, Mongolia, South Korea, and Yunnan, and Guangdong Province and northern Vietnam were restored from Nanyue. Han's involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route on the Silk Road and replaced the previous road from the Himalayas to India. Han China gradually became the largest economy in the ancient world. Despite the official abandonment of Qin's legalist philosophy in favor of Han's first decentralization and Confucianism, Qin's legalist system and policies continued to be adopted by the Han government and its successors. After the end of the Han dynasty, a period of conflict known as the Three Kingdoms era continued, and its central figure later became immortal in one of the four great masterworks of Chinese literature. At the end, Wei was rapidly overthrown by the Jin dynasty. Jin fell into a civil war due to the ascension of the emperor with developmental disabilities. After that, the Five Barbarians invaded northern China and ruled as 16 states. Xianbei unified them as Northern Wei, and Emperor Xiaowen overturned his predecessor apartheid policy, forced a thorough Chineseization of his subject, and integrated them primarily into Chinese culture. In the south, General Liu Yu supported Jin's abdication in support of Liu Song. The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern Courts, and in 581 the two regions were finally reunited by Sui. Sui returned Han to power through China, reformed agriculture, economy, and the Imperial Examination System, built a great canal, and sponsored Buddhism. However, they fell rapidly when recruitment to public works and the failure of the war in northern South Korea caused widespread anxiety. In the following Tang and Song eras, China's economy, technology and culture entered a golden age. The Tang Empire regained control of the western region and the Silk Road, taking traders to the corners of Mesopotamia and Africa, making the capital, Chang An, the center of an international city. However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan Rebellion of the 8th century. In 907, when the local military governor became uncontrollable, the Tang dynasty completely collapsed. The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960 and brought about a balance of power between Song and Liao Kitan. Song was the first government in the history of the world to issue banknotes and was the first Chinese government to establish a permanent navy supported by the development of the shipbuilding industry and maritime trade. From the 10th to the 11th centuries, China's population doubled to about 100 million. This is mainly due to the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also prospered philosophy and art as Confucianism revived in response to the growth of Buddhism in the Tang dynasty, and landscape painting and porcelain brought a new level of maturity and complexity. However, the weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchen Jin dynasty. In 1127, Emperor Huizong and the capital Emperor Huizong were captured during the Song Dynasty War. The remnants of Song withdrew to southern China. The 13th century brought about the conquest of China by Mongolia. In 1271, Mongolian leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty. Originally conquered the last remnants of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the invasion of Mongolia, Song China had a population of 120 million. This was reduced to 60 million at the time of the 1300 census. A farmer named Hongwu Emperor overthrew the renminbi in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as Hongwu Emperor. During the Ming Dynasty, China entered a new golden age, developing one of the world's most powerful navies and a prosperous and prosperous economy in the prosperity of art and culture. It was during this period that Admiral Zheng He led the voyage of the Ming treasures throughout the Indian Ocean and extended to East Africa. In the early Ming dynasty, the capital of China was moved from Nanjing to Beijing. With the emergence of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming further criticized and expanded New Confucianism with the notions of individualism and the equality of the four professions. The scholar-official layer became an industrial and commercial supporter of the tax boycott movement and ran out of treasury, along with famine and Japan's defense against South Korea's invasion of South Korea (1592-1598) and Manchuria. In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng. Emperor Chongzhen committed suicide when the city collapsed. The Manchu Qing dynasty formed an alliance with General Wu Sangui of the Ming dynasty, overthrew Lee's short-lived Shun dynasty, and then took control of Beijing, the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 to 1912, was the last imperial dynasty in China. The conquest of Ming (1618–1683) claimed the lives of 25 million people and dramatically reduced China's economy. After the end of Nanming, further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to the empire. Centralized dictatorship is a policy that values ​​agriculture, curbs commerce (“haijin”), and curbs ideological controls such as literary quests, causing social and technological stagnation. Was strengthened to crack down on anti-Qing sentiment. In the mid-19th century, the dynasty experienced Western imperialism in the Opium War between Britain and France. China was forced to pay compensation, open a treaty port, grant extraterritoriality to foreigners, and transfer Hong Kong to the United Kingdom under the first Treaty of Nanking in the 1842 unequal treaty. The Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) resulted in the loss of influence of Qing China on the Korean Peninsula and the ceding of Taiwan to Japan. The Qing dynasty also began to experience a civil war that killed tens of millions, especially in the White Lotus Rebellion, the Taiping Rebellion that struck southern China in the 1850s and 1860s, and the Dungan Revolt in the northwest (1862–77). I did. The first success of the Western affairs movement in the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s. In the 19th century, the great diaspora of overseas Chinese began. Immigrant losses were added by famine-like conflicts and catastrophes in northern China from 1876 to 1979. There, 9 to 13 million people died. Emperor Guangxu drafted reform plans in 1898 to establish a constitutional monarchy, but these plans were thwarted by Empress Dowager Cixi. The unlucky anti-foreign boxer rebellion of 1899-1901 further weakened the dynasty. Cixi sponsored a reform program, but the Yin Metal Pig of 1911-12 ended the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China. On January 1, 1912, the Republic of China was established and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (KMT or Kuomintang) was declared as interim president. However, the president was later given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing dynasty who declared himself the emperor of China in 1915. Faced with general criticism and opposition from his own North Sea forces, he was forced to abdicate and rebuild the republic. After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, China was politically fragmented. The Beijing-based government was internationally recognized, but virtually powerless. Local warlords ruled most of the territory. In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek, then principal of the Army Academy, reunited the country under its control through a series of clever military and political operations collectively known as the North. Was completed. expedition. The Kuomintang moved the capital of the country to Nanjing and implemented "political guidance". This is an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles Program to Transform China into a Modern Democratic State. Due to China's political division, it was difficult for Chen to fight the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA), which the Kuomintang had fought in the Chinese Civil War since 1927. The war continued successfully for the Kuomintang, especially after the PLA withdrew in the Long March, until the invasion of Japan and the 1936 Xi'an Incident forced Chen to confront the Empire of Japan. The Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), the setting of World War II, forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the People's Party. The Japanese army committed a number of war atrocities against civilians. A total of 20 million Chinese civilians have died. During the Japanese colonial era, an estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were slaughtered in Nanjing alone. During the war, China, along with the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union, was called "strong trust" and was recognized as the "Big Four" of the Allies in the United Nations Declaration. Along with the other three powers, China was one of the four major allies of World War II and was later regarded as one of the major victors of the war. After Japan surrendered in 1945, Taiwan, including the Penghu Islands, was returned to Chinese control. China won, but was devastated by the war and financially exhausted. Continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of the civil war. The rules of the Constitution were enacted in 1947, but due to continued unrest, many provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of China were not enforced in mainland China. Massive combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, with the Communist Party controlling most of mainland China, and the Kuomintang withdrawing offshore, limiting its territory to Taiwan, Hainan, and the surrounding islands. On September 21, 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong made a speech at the first general meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, proclaiming the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Then, on October 1st, a public celebration was held at Tiananmen Square, where Mao publicly proclaimed. This day was the first National Foundation Day of a new country. In 1950, the PLA occupied Hainan from the ROC and incorporated Tibet. However, the rest of the National Revolutionary Army continued to revolt in western China throughout the 1950s. The administration has increased its popularity among farmers through land reform, including the execution of one to two million landlords. China has developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons. China's population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974. However, the Great Leap Forward, an idealistic large-scale reform project, killed an estimated 15 to 35 million people between 1958 and 1961, primarily due to hunger. In 1966, Mao Zedong and his allies began the Cultural Revolution, causing political criticism and social turmoil for the decade that followed until Mao Zedong's death in 1976. In October 1971, China replaced the Republic at the United Nations and became a permanent member of the Security Council. Immediately after Mao's death, the gang of four were arrested and held accountable for the overkill of the Cultural Revolution. Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978 and began significant economic reforms. The party loosened government control over the private lives of its citizens, and the commune gradually dissolved and favored working with households. This marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment. China adopted the current Constitution on December 4, 1982. In 1989, the violent repression of student protests at Tiananmen Square resulted in sanctions against the Chinese government from various countries. Jiang Zemin, Li Peng and Zhu Rongji led the country in the 1990s. Under their administration, China's economic performance rescued an estimated 150 million farmers from poverty and maintained an average GDP growth rate of 112%. The country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and maintained a high economic growth rate in the 2000s under the guidance of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao. However, its growth has also had a serious impact on the country's resources and environment, causing great social migration. Despite the recession in the late 2000s, living standards continued to improve rapidly, but political control remained tight. Preparations for leadership changes over the decade of 2012 were characterized by factional debates and political scandals. At the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in November 2012, Hu Jintao replaced Xi Jinping on behalf of the Communist Party General Secretary. Under Xi, the Chinese government has launched a major effort to reform an economy suffering from structural instability and slowing growth. The Xi-Li administration has also announced major reforms in its one-child policy and prison system. In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus, later identified as COVID-19, broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, then spread to other states in China and then worldwide, becoming a pandemic for COVID-19. As of June 2020, more than 7.24 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, more than 411,000 have died and 3.37 million have recovered. China's landscapes are vast and diverse, ranging from the dry northern Gobi and Taklimakan deserts to the damp southern subtropical forests. The Himalayas, Karakorum, Pamir and the Tianshan Mountains separate China from most of South and Central Asia. The Yangtze River and Huang River, which are the third and sixth longest in the world, flow from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated east coast, respectively. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometers (9,000 miles) long, Bohai, Yellow, East Surrounded by the sea of ​​China and South China. China connects to the Eurasian Steppe, an artery connecting east and west, via the Kazakh border and through the Steppe Route, the ancestor of the Silk Road on land since the Neolithic period. China's territory lies between latitudes 18-54 degrees north and longitude 73-135 degrees east. The geographical center of China is marked by the center of the National Monument. The landscape of China varies greatly across its vast territory. In the east, along the coasts of the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, there is a vast and densely populated alluvial plain, and at the edge of the northern Inner Mongolia Plateau, wide grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, and in the eastern central part are the two major rivers of China, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River Delta. Other major rivers include Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west are the major mountains, especially the Himalayas. The plateau is in the drier landscape of the north, such as the Taklimakan Desert and the Gobi Desert. Mount Everest (8,848), the highest point in the world m) is on the border between China and Nepal. The lowest point in the country and the third lowest point in the world is the dry bottom of Lake Aiding (-154m) in the Turpan Depression. China's climate is dominated by the dry and rainy monsoons, with significant temperature differences between winter and summer. In winter, the northerly winds coming from high latitudes are cold and dry. In summer, the southerly winds from low latitude coastal areas are warm and moist. The climate of China is so complex that the climate of China varies from region to region. China's major environmental problem is the continued expansion of its desert, especially the Gobi Desert. Barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms, but prolonged droughts and poor agricultural practices cause sandstorms that hit northern China every spring, including Japan and South Korea in East Asia. Spread to other areas. SEPA, China's environmental monitoring agency, announced in 2007 that 4,000 annually due to desertification in China. He said he was losing km (1,500 square miles). Water quality, erosion and pollution control are important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting Himalayan glaciers can lead to water scarcity for hundreds of millions of people. China has a very agricultural climate and is the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplants, grapes, watermelons and spinach. China is one of 17 huge countries, located in the Palearctic and Indomalayan realms, two of the world's major biogeographic regions. On one scale, China has more than 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making it the third most biodiversity country in the world after Brazil and Colombia. The country signed the Rio de Janeiro Convention on Biodiversity on June 11, 1992 and became a party to the Convention on January 5, 1993. It then developed a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was revised at the convention on September 21, 2010. China is home to at least 551 mammals (the third highest number in the world), 1,221 birds (8th), 424 reptiles (7th) and 333 amphibians (7th). .. China's wildlife shares its habitat with the world's largest population and withstands intense pressure from it. In China, at least 840 species of animals are endangered, vulnerable or endangered, mainly due to human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, food, fur and poaching of raw materials for Chinese herbs. Is on the verge of Endangered wildlife is protected by law, and as of 2005, the country has more than 2,349 nature reserves with a total area of ​​149.95 million hectares, the total area of ​​China. It accounts for 15%. Baiji kawaika was confirmed to be extinct on December 12, 2006. There are more than 32,000 species of vascular plants in China, and there are various types of forests. Cold coniferous forests predominate in the northern part of the country, supporting animal species such as elk and black bears and more than 120 species of birds. Understory vegetation in moist coniferous forests may contain bamboo bushes. In the higher mountainous areas of Juniper and Yew, bamboo is replaced by rhododendron. The predominant subtropical forests in central and southern China support as many as 146,000 flora. Rainforests and Seasonal Rainforests are confined to Yunnan and Hainan Island, but contain a quarter of all animal and plant species found in China. More than 10,000 species of fungi have been recorded in China, of which nearly 6,000 are higher fungi. Over the last few decades, China has suffered from serious environmental degradation and pollution. Regulations such as the Environmental Protection Act of 1979 are fairly strict, but are inadequate because they are often ignored by local communities and government authorities in support of rapid economic development. Urban air pollution is a serious national health problem, but the problem has improved in recent years. In 2016, the World Bank estimated that only one of the 20 most polluted cities in the world was in China, a significant improvement over previous rankings. China is the second largest country after India in terms of deaths from air pollution. About 1 million people have died as a result of exposure to air pollution. China is the largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world. The country also has serious water pollution problems. Eighty-two percent of China's rivers were contaminated with industrial and agricultural waste in 2019, making them unsuitable for use. In 2014, China's per capita internal freshwater resources fell to 2,062m, below 500m in the North China Plain, but 5,920m worldwide. Heavy metals also cause environmental pollution in China. Heavy metal contamination is an inorganic chemical hazard, mainly due to lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt. Is triggered. (Co), and nickel (Ni). Five of these metals, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are China's major heavy metal pollutants. Heavy metal pollutants originate primarily from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacture of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High levels of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral disorders, hearing loss, attention disorders, and disruption of visual and motor function development. According to census data, China has more than 1.5 million heavy metal exposure sites. The total amount of heavy metals discharged into wastewater, waste gas and solid waste is about 900,000 tons every year from 2005 to 2011. However, China is one of the world's leading investors in renewable energy and its commercialization, with $ 52 billion invested in 2011 alone. A leading manufacturer of renewable energy technology, we have invested heavily in regional renewable energy projects. By 2015, more than 24% of China's energy came from renewable energy sources, especially from hydropower. Total installed capacity is 197 GW, China is the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world. China also has the largest power capacity in the world among the installed solar and wind power systems. In 2011, the Chinese government announced plans to invest 4 trillion yuan (US $ 619.0 billion) in water infrastructure and desalination projects over a 10-year period and complete the construction of flood and drought prevention systems by 2020. In 2013, China launched a five-year US $ 277 billion effort to reduce air pollution, especially in the northern part of the country. The People's Republic of China is the second largest country in the world in terms of land area after Russia, and the third largest in total area after Russia and Canada. The total area of ​​China is generally said to be about 9,600,000 km (3,700,000 square miles). Specific area figures are 9,572,900 according to the United Nations Demographic Yearbook and the CIA World Factbook. From km (3,696,100 square miles) to 9,596,961 It ranges up to km (3,705,407 square miles). In China, the distance from the mouth of the Yalu River (Amnok River) to the Gulf of Tonkin is 22,117. At km (13,743 miles), it has the longest border in the world. China borders 14 countries, more than any other country except Russia, and borders 14 countries. China extends to most of East Asia and borders Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar (Burma) in Southeast Asia. South Asia India, Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Pakistan. Central Asia Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan. Inner Asia and Northeast Asia Russia, Mongolia, North Korea. In addition, China shares maritime boundaries with South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines. China's constitution states that the People's Republic of China is "a socialist country under the people's democratic dictatorship, led by the worker class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants," and state agencies "apply the principle of democratic centralism." "It has said. China is one of the only socialist countries in the world that is clearly aiming to build communism. The Chinese government has been variously described as a communist and socialist, but also as an authoritarian and a corporateist, with severe restrictions in many areas. In particular, free access to the Internet, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to have children, the free formation of social organizations and the freedom of religion. Its current political, ideological, and economic systems, by its leaders, are "consultative democracy," "people's democracy," and "socialism with Chinese characteristics," respectively (China's situation. Adapted to Marxism), called the "socialist market economy." Lutgard According to Lams, "President Xi is making great attempts to" sanitize "Marxist-Leninist ideas" with Chinese characteristics "in the political arena." Since 2018, the body of the Chinese Constitution has declared that "a distinctive feature of socialism with Chinese features is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)." The 2018 amendment is a constitutionalization of China's one-party status, with the secretary-general (leader) having the ultimate power and authority over the nation and government, and serving as China's supreme leader. I'm playing. The election system is a pyramid. Local People's Congress is directly elected, and higher-level People's Congress up to the National People's Congress (NPC) is indirectly elected by the people's convention at the immediately lower level. The political system is decentralized and state and sub-provincial leaders have considerable autonomy. The other eight parties are represented by NPCs and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). China supports the Leninist principle of "democratic centralism," but critics describe the elected National People's Congress as a "rubber stamp" institution. The President is the nominal head of state elected by the National People's Congress. The prime minister is the head of government and presides over the State Council, which consists of four deputy prime ministers and heads of ministries. The current president is Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the chairman of the Central Military Commission, and the supreme leader of China. The incumbent Prime Minister is Li Keqiang, who is also a senior member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Politburo, China's highest decision-making body. There are some moves towards political liberalization, with public elections currently taking place at the village and town levels. However, political parties continue to effectively manage government appointments. In most cases, CPC wins by default if there is no meaningful opposition. In 2017, Xi called on the Communist Party to further strengthen its grip on the country, maintain unity of party leadership, and achieve its "dream of rejuvenation of the Chinese people." China's political concerns include widening the gap between the rich and the poor and government corruption. Nevertheless, according to a 2011 survey, the level of public support for the government and its control is high, with 80-95% of Chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government. The People's Republic of China is divided into 22 states, 5 autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), 4 municipalities (collectively referred to as "Mainland China"), and Hong Kong and Special Administrative Regions (SAR). increase. Macau. Geographically, all 31 subdivisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China, Northeast China, East China, South Central China, Southwest China, and Northwest China. China considers Taiwan the 23rd state, but Taiwan is governed by the People's Republic of China (ROC) and rejects China's claim. Conversely, the ROC claims sovereignty over all departments governed by the PRC. China has diplomatic relations with 175 countries and has embassies in 162 countries. Its legitimacy is being contested by the Republic of China and several other countries. Therefore, it is the largest and most populous state with limited awareness. In 1971, China replaced the Republic of China as China's sole representative of the United Nations and one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. China also believes to be a former member and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement and still a defender of developing countries. China, along with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, is a member of the BRICS group in emerging major economies and hosted the group's third official summit in Sanya, Hainan Province in April 2011. Under one China policy interpretation, Beijing made it a prerequisite for establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledged its allegations against Taiwan and cut off its official ties with the Government of the Republic of China. Chinese officials have protested many opportunities for foreign countries to make diplomatic overtures to Taiwan, especially with regard to the sale of weapons. Much of China's current foreign policy is based on Prime Minister Zhou Enlai's five principles of peaceful coexistence and is driven by the concept of "unified harmony" that promotes diplomatic relations between nations despite differences in ideas. It is reported that there is. This policy may have helped China support countries considered dangerous or oppressive by Western nations such as Zimbabwe, North Korea and Iran. China has close economic and military ties with Russia, and the two states often vote unanimously on the UN Security Council. China became the world's largest trading nation in 2013, measured by total imports and exports. By 2016, China had become the largest trading partner of the other 124 countries. In 2019, China's goods and services exports were $ 25 trillion and imports were $ 21 trillion, resulting in $ 46 trillion in foreign trade. Over the last few decades, China has played an increasingly important role in seeking free trade areas and security agreements among its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region. China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on December 11, 2001. In 2004, he proposed a whole new East Asia Summit (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues. ASEAN None 3. EAS, including India, Australia and New Zealand, held its first summit in 2005. China, along with Russia and the Republic of Central Asia, is also a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). China has long and complex trade relations with the United States. In 2000, the US Congress approved a "Permanent Normal Trade Relations" (PNTR) with China, permitting China to export at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries. China has a large trade surplus with the United States, its most important export market. In the early 2010s, US politicians argued that the Chinese yuan was significantly undervalued, giving China an unfair trade advantage. Since the turn of the century, China has followed a policy of cooperating with African countries for trade and bilateral cooperation. In 2012, total trade in Central Africa exceeded US $ 160 billion. China maintains a healthy and highly diversified trade relationship with the European Union. China has further strengthened its ties with South America's major economies, becoming Brazil's largest trading partner and building strategic ties with Argentina. China's Belt and Road Initiative has expanded significantly over the past six years, including 137 countries and 30 international organizations as of 2019. Since its establishment after the Second China Civil War, China has claimed as part of its territory a territory governed by the Republic of China (ROC), an independent political organization commonly known today as Taiwan. We consider Taiwan Island as part of Taiwan Province, Jinmen and Pine as part of Fujian Province, and ROC-controlled islands in the South China Sea as part of Hainan and Guangdong Provinces. These claims are controversial due to the complex cross-strait relations. China treats one China policy as one of its most important diplomatic principles. In addition to Taiwan, China is also involved in other international territorial disputes. Since the 1990s, China has been involved in negotiations to resolve disputed land borders, such as the disputed border with India and the undefined border with Bhutan. China is also involved in multilateral disputes over ownership of several small islands in the East China Sea and South China Sea, such as the Senkaku Islands and the Scarborough Shawl. On May 21, 2014, Xi Jinping spoke at a conference in Shanghai, promising to peacefully resolve China's territorial disputes. "China remains committed to seeking a peaceful resolution of disputes with other nations over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests," he said. China is regularly welcomed as a potential new superpower, with certain commentators playing an important role globally in the 21st century, with its rapid economic development, increasing military power, and a very large population. He cites increasing international influence as a sign of fulfillment. But others have warned that as the century progresses, an imbalance between the bubble economy and demographics can slow or stall China's growth. It lacks US military and cultural influence. Others, IRENA, argue that China's investment in renewable energy has probably positioned China as a superpower in its field, especially due to changes in global trade relations. Democracy movements of China, social activists, and some members of the Chinese Communist Party believe in the need for social and political reforms. Economic and social control has been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, but political freedom remains severely restricted. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China states that citizens' "basic rights" include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights. .. However, in reality, these provisions do not provide significant protection against criminal charges by the state. While criticisms of government policy and the ruling Communist Party are acceptable, political speech and censorship of information are routinely used to prevent collective action, especially on the Internet. By 2020, China plans to give all citizens a personal "social credit" score based on their actions. Currently, the Social Credit System, which is piloted in many cities in China, is considered a form of mass surveillance using big data analysis technology. In 2005, Reporters Without Borders was ranked 159th out of 167 states in the Annual Press Freedom Index. This shows that the level of freedom of the press is very low. In 2014, China was ranked 175th out of 180 countries. Rural immigrants to Chinese cities are often treated as second-class citizens by a household registration system that controls access to national interests. Property rights are often not well protected, but since the early 2000s many local taxes have been reduced or abolished, providing additional social services to local residents. Many foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and NGOs allege widespread civil rights infringement, including untrial detention, forced abortion, forced confessions, torture, restrictions on basic rights, and excessive use of death penalties. Criticizes China's civil rights records. None The government has curbed general protests and demonstrations that it considers to be a potential threat to "social stability," as was the case with the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest. Falun Gong was first publicly taught in 1992. In 1999, when there were about 70 million practitioners, the persecution of Falun Gong began, with reports of mass arrests, exorbitant detention, torture and death in custody. The Chinese state is regularly accused of massive crackdowns and human rights abuses in Tibet and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. This includes violent police crackdowns and religious oppression. At least one million members of the Chinese Muslim Uighur minority are called "vocational education and training centers" aimed at changing the political thinking, their identities, and their religious beliefs of detainees. Detained in a mass detention camp. The camp was established under the control of General Secretary Xi Jinping. In January 2019, the United Nations detained 1.1 million Uighurs, Kazakhs, Hui, and other ethnic minorities after receiving a "trustworthy report" of detention in these camps, after the Panel said. I asked for direct access to the place. The state is also threatening foreign-based reporters by detaining families in an attempt to manage offshore reports of tensions in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Foreign criticism by the Chinese government by arguing that self-sufficiency and the right to economic development are prerequisites for other types of human rights, and that the concept of human rights should take into account the country's current level of economic development. Has responded to. It underscores China's standard of living since the 1970s, literacy rates, increased life expectancy, improved workplace safety, and long-standing efforts to combat natural disasters such as the Janze River flood. In addition, some Chinese politicians have said in favor of democratization, while others remain more conservative. Several major reform efforts have been made. For example, in November 2013, the government announced plans to ease the one-child policy and abolish the criticized re-education through labor programs, but human rights groups have stated that the latter reforms are largely superficial. increase. From the 2000s to the early 2010s, the Chinese government became more and more tolerant of NGOs that provided practical and efficient solutions to social problems, but such "third sector" activities remained. It was strictly regulated. China's human rights have deteriorated since Xi Jinping took over as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012. Global Slavery In 2016, more than 3.8 million people lived in "modern slavery," according to the Index, which includes victims of trafficking, forced labor, forced marriage, child labor, and state forced labor. It is estimated to account for 025%. Labor. Everything except the last category is illegal. The state-imposed compulsory system was officially abolished in 2013, but it is not clear to what extent its various practices have ceased. China's criminal system includes labor prison factories, detention centers, and re-education camps under the heading Laogai (“Labor Remodeling”). The Laogai Research Foundation in the United States estimated that there were more than 1000 slave labor prisons and camps, collectively known as Laogai. The prisoner is not paid at all and must send money to his family. Prisoners who refuse to work are beaten and some are beaten to death. Many prisoners are political or religious dissidents, and some are internationally recognized as prisoners of conscience. Chinese leaders said they wanted to see two products coming out of prison: a reformed man and a product made by him. Harry Wu, a former Laogai prisoner, was charged with stealing state secrets by filming a secret footage of Laogai. For this reason, Harry Wu was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but was only in prison for 66 days before being deported to the United States. In 2019, the world's first study called for the mass withdrawal of more than 400 scientific papers on organ transplants due to concerns that organs might have been unethically obtained from Chinese prisoners. This study was published in the medical journal BMJ Open. A report released in 2016 found that there was a large discrepancy between the official number of transplants from the Chinese government and the number of transplants reported by hospitals. The government states that 10,000 transplants are made each year, but hospital data show that 60,000 to 100,000 organs are transplanted each year. The report provided evidence that this gap was filled by prisoners of conscience. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has 2.3 million active troops and is the largest active troop in the world under the command of the Central Military Commission (CMC). China has the second largest reserve force after North Korea. The PLA consists of the Ground Forces (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF), and the PLA Rocket Force (PLARF). According to the Chinese government, China's military budget in 2017 totaled US $ 151.5 billion, making up the world's second-largest military budget, but military spending and 13% of GDP's GDP ratio is below the world average. There is. However, many authorities, including SIPRI and the United States Office of the Secretary of Defense – China claims it has not reported actual levels of military spending, which are allegedly much higher than the official budget. As a recognized nuclear-weapon state, China is considered both a major regional military force and a potential military superpower. According to a 2013 report by the US Department of Defense, China has deployed 50 to 75 nuclear ICBMs and a large number of SRBMs. However, compared to the other four permanent members of the UN Security Council, China has a relatively limited power projection capability. To offset this, a number of power projection assets have been developed since the early 2000s, the first aircraft carrier was put into service in 2012, maintaining a significant number of submarines, including several nuclear attack submarines and ballistic missile submarines. I am. China has also established a network of foreign military relations along important sea lanes. China has made great strides in modernizing the Air Force in recent decades, Sukhoi Buy Russian fighters such as the Su-30 and buy your own modern fighters, especially Chengdu Manufactures J-10, J-20, Shenyang J-. 11, J-15, J-16, and J-31. China is also working on the development of indigenous stealth aircraft and numerous combat drones. Advances in air and sea refusal weapons have increased the threat to the region from the perspective of Japan and Washington. China has also updated its ground forces, replacing its aging \\ u200b \\ u200b tank inventory with numerous variations of the latest Type 99 tanks, upgrading the C3I and C4I systems on the battlefield, and network-centric. Strengthened the fighting ability of. In addition, China has developed or acquired a number of advanced missile systems, including anti-satellite missiles, cruise missiles, and submarine-launched nuclear ICBMs. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China became the world's third-largest exporter of major weapons in 2010-14, up 143 percent from 2005-09. SIPRI also calculated that China will surpass Russia and become the world's second largest arms exporter by 2020. Chinese officials said spending on the military would rise to the United States $ 173 billion in 2018. Between 2014 and 2018, China was the world's fifth largest exporter of arms, up 27% compared to the previous period. In August 2018, China tested its first hypersonic flight. The China Aerospace Aerodynamics Academy (CAAA) claims to have successfully tested the Starry Sky-2 aircraft in contact with the speed of Mach 6 (six times the speed of sound) capable of carrying nuclear missiles. Since 2010, China has been the world's second largest economy in terms of nominal GDP, with a total value of approximately US $ 135 trillion (90 trillion yuan) as of 2018. Purchasing power parity (PPP), according to the World Bank In terms of GDP), China's economy is the largest in the world since 2014. According to the World Bank, China's GDP has increased from $ 150 billion in 1978 to $ 136 trillion by 2018. China's economic growth has consistently exceeded 6% since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978. China is also the world's largest exporter and the second largest importer of commodities. Between 2010 and 2019, China's contribution to global GDP growth was 25% to 39%. China has had the largest economy in the world for most of the last 2000 years. Meanwhile, China has experienced a cycle of prosperity and decline. Since the beginning of economic reforms in 1978, China has developed into a highly diversified economy and has become one of the most important players in international trade. The major competitive sectors include manufacturing, retail, mining, steel, textiles, automobiles, energy generation, green energy, banking, electronics, telecommunications, real estate, e-commerce, and tourism. China has three of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world (Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen) with a market capitalization of over $ 10 trillion as of 2019. China is the best in the world. 1 company since 2010. 1 for the last 100 years. Not so in China. According to the National Science Foundation, it has been in high-tech manufacturing since 2012 2. China is the second largest retail market in the world after the United States. China is the world leader in e-commerce, with 40% of the world market share in 2016 and more than 50% of the world market share in 2019. China is a world leader in electric vehicles, manufacturing and purchasing half of all plug-in electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs) in the world in 2018. By the end of 2018, China had 174 GW of PV installed, which is more than 40% of the world's PV capacity. As of 2018, China was the number one millionaire in the world and the second largest millionaire, with 658 millionaires and 3.5 million millionaires in China. However, per capita economic output lags behind more than 70 countries (out of about 180 countries), making it a middle-income country. Moreover, its development is very uneven. Its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous than rural and inland areas. China has rescued more people from extreme poverty than any other country in history. Between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million. China has reduced its extreme poverty rate from 88% in 1981 to 185% by 2013, meaning less than $ 190 a day in income according to international standards. According to the World Bank, the number of Chinese in extreme poverty fell from 756 million to 25 million between 1990 and 2013. China's own national poverty standard is higher, so the national poverty rate was 31% in 2017 and 1% in 2018. In 2019, China overtook the United States as the home of the world's richest people, according to Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Report. In other words, as of 2019, 100 million Chinese are among the top 10% of the wealthiest individuals in the world. That is, an individual with a net personal wealth of $ 110,000 or more. From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally planned economy. Following Mao Zedong's death in 1976 and the end of the resulting Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping and new Chinese leaders began to reform their economies, moving towards a more market-oriented mixed economy under one-party rule. I did. Agricultural groupings have been dismantled and agricultural land has been privatized, but foreign trade has become a major new focus and has led to the creation of special economic zones (SEZs). Massive unemployment has occurred as inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been rebuilt and unprofitable enterprises have been completely closed. Modern China is characterized by having a market economy primarily based on the ownership of private property and is one of the representative examples of state capitalism. While the state still dominates strategic "pillar" sectors such as energy production and heavy industry, private enterprises have expanded significantly, with approximately 30 million private enterprises recorded in 2008. In 2018, Chinese private companies accounted for 60% of GDP, 80% of urban employment and 90% of new employment. In 2015, China's middle class became the largest in the world. By 2019, the wealthiest 10% of people in the world had more Chinese than Americans. Since the beginning of economic liberalization in 1978, China has been one of the fastest growing economies in the world, initially relying on investment-led and export-led growth, but now consuming. Is shifting to. In 2018, 76% of China's GDP growth was due to consumption. According to the IMF, China's average annual GDP growth rate from 2001 to 2010 was 105%. In the years immediately following the 2007 financial crisis, China's economic growth rate was comparable to the combined growth of all G7 countries. According to the Global Growth Generators Index released by Citigroup in February 2011, China's 3G growth rate is very high. Its high productivity, low labor costs, and relatively good infrastructure make it a world leader in manufacturing. China is No 1 In steel, aluminum and automobile production — China's global market share is 50% in steel, 50% in aluminum and 30% in automobile manufacturing. China is also increasingly looking to automation, becoming the world's largest market for industrial robots in 2013. Between 2010 and 2015, China installed 90,000 industrial robots. That's one-third of the world. In 2017, China purchased 36% of all new industrial robots in the world. China's plan is to design and manufacture 100,000 industrial robots domestically by 2020. However, the Chinese economy is very energy intensive and inefficient. China became the world's largest energy consumer in 2010, relying on coal to supply more than 70% of its energy demand, and in 2013 surpassed the United States to become the world's largest oil importer. Over the last decade, China has become the number one in the world in terms of installed solar capacity, hydropower and wind power. According to the World Economic Forum, China will account for 40% of the world's renewable energy by 2022. In addition, official GDP figures are considered unreliable, and some examples of data manipulation are widely known. In the early 2010s, China's economic growth rate began to slow in the face of domestic credit problems, weakening international demand for China's exports and weakening the global economy. China's GDP was lower than Germany's in 2007. But by 2017, China's $ 122 trillion economy was larger than Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy combined. In 2018, the IMF reiterated its prediction that China will overtake the United States in nominal GDP by 2030. Economists also expect China's middle class to grow to 600 million by 2025. Tourism is a major contributor to the economy. In 2017, the sector contributed about 877 trillion yuan (US $ 135 trillion), or 1104% of GDP, and contributed to direct and indirect employment of up to 28.25 million people. There were 139.48 million inbound trips and 5 billion domestic trips. China is not now. It is one of the skyscrapers (buildings with a height of 200 m or more) and occupies about 50% of the whole world. In the four years from 2015 to 2018, China built 310 skyscrapers, with 33 corresponding numbers in the United States. China is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. It is the world's largest e-commerce market, reaching 42% of the global market by 2016 and expected to account for 55% of global e-commerce retail sales in 2019 (three times the US market). that's all). According to PWC, online sales in China's e-commerce market are expected to exceed $ 1 trillion in 2018 and fall to just under $ 2 trillion in 2019. China's e-commerce industry took off in 2009, and Internet giants Tencent and Alibaba (providers of products such as WeChat and Tmall) have grown and become ubiquitous in modern Chinese life. Tencent's WeChat Pay and Alibaba's AliPay are helping China become a global leader in mobile payments. This exceeded about $ 30 trillion in China in 2017 and $ 40 trillion in 2018. China is also the second largest venture capital firm after the United States and home to a number of unicorn start-ups. In 2018, China attracted $ 105 billion in venture capital investment, equivalent to 38% of the global \\ u200b \\ u200b VC investment of the year. In late 2018, the most valuable startup in the world was the Chinese company ByteDance. And the two most valuable artificial intelligence (AI) startups in the world were both China's SenseTime and Face ++. In 2017, the State Council of China announced an artificial intelligence development plan. The plan declares that AI technology is the preferred economic growth and investment sector. In 2018, China created 97 "unicorns" (startups worth over $ 1 billion). This is equivalent to one unicorn every 3.8 days. Chinese smartphone brand – Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus and more. – We have more than 40% of the world market. By 2019, Huawei has overtaken Nokia and Ericsson to become the world's largest telecommunications infrastructure provider, taking the lead in 5G technology. The company has also entered the consumer smartphone and enterprise services market, making it the third largest smartphone company in the world after Apple and Samsung. Other Chinese tech giants include DJI (the world's largest drone maker with a 70% market share), BOE (the world's largest flat panel display maker), and Didi (the world's largest and most valuable ride-sharing company). , BYD (the world's largest plug-in vehicle) includes manufacturers (including both BEV and PHEV) China also has the largest number of supercomputers, 227 of the top 500 (as of 2019). China is also a world leader in patents, accounting for 1.54 million patents in 2018, almost half of the world's patents. China's R & D spending has increased rapidly over the past decade, reaching $ 277 billion in 2017. China is a member of the WTO and the world's largest trading nation, with total international trade of US $ 462 trillion in 2018. Foreign exchange reserves reached US $ 31 trillion in 2019, making it the largest foreign exchange reserve in the world. In 2012, China was the world's largest beneficiary of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), raising $ 253 billion. In 2014, China's foreign exchange remittances amounted to US $ 64 billion, making it the second largest remittance destination in the world. China is also investing abroad, with a total foreign direct investment of $ 62.4 billion in 2012, with numerous large-scale acquisitions of foreign companies by Chinese companies. China is a major owner of US public debt, holding trillions of dollars worth of US Government bonds. China's undervalued exchange rates have created friction with other major economies and have also been widely criticized for producing large quantities of counterfeit goods. China is ranked 17th in the world in the Global Innovation Index, not far from the US, which is ranked 6th. China ranks 27th out of 137 countries in the 2017-2018 World Competitiveness Index, surpassing many developed countries and becoming the most competitive and major emerging economy. This is mainly due to the strength of the infrastructure and the widespread adoption of communications and information technologies. However, it lags behind developed countries in labor market efficiency, institutional strength, and openness of market competition, especially for foreign players seeking to enter the domestic market. In 2018, the Global 500 list of the world's largest companies included 120 Chinese companies. Many of the world's largest public companies are Chinese, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank in total assets. After the 2007-2008 financial crisis, Chinese authorities sought to aggressively cut off their dependence on the United States. The dollar as a result of the recognition of weaknesses in the international monetary system. To achieve these goals, China has taken a series of actions to promote the internationalization of the renminbi. In 2008, China established a dim bond market and expanded its cross-border RMB settlement pilot project. This will help establish a pool of offshore RMB liquidity. Following this, bilateral agreements were signed with Russia, Japan, Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and Canada to settle transactions directly in the RMB. As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, the renminbi has become the eighth most traded currency in the world, the new international reserve currency and a component of the IMF's Special Drawing Rights. However, due in part to capital restrictions that cause the renminbi to not be a fully convertible currency, international trade volumes are far behind the euro, dollar and Japanese yen. China has the largest middle class population in the world since 2015, and by 2018 the middle class had grown to a scale of 400 million. By 2012, China's middle-class population (when defined as a population with an annual income between $ 10,000 and $ 60,000) had reached more than 300 million. Wages in China have increased exponentially over the last 40 years. Actual (inflation-adjusted) wages increased seven-fold between 1978 and 2007. By 2018, median wages in Chinese cities such as Shanghai were about the same as or higher than those in Eastern European countries. More than 75% of Chinese urban consumers are expected to earn RMB 60,000-229,000 annually by 2022. The number of billionaires in China is the second highest in the world, reaching nearly 400 as of 2018, increasing at a rate of about 2 per week. China's domestic retail market was worth more than 20 trillion yuan (US $ 32 trillion) in 2012 and has grown by more than 12% every year as of 2013, but China's luxury goods market has a very large share of 275% in the world. Is expanding to. However, in recent years, China's rapid economic growth has contributed to severe consumer inflation, leading to tighter government regulation. China has a high degree of economic inequality, which has increased in the last few decades. In 2012, China's official Gini coefficient was 0474. According to a survey conducted by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, China's Gini coefficient actually reached 061 in 2012, with the top 1% of Chinese holding more than 25% of China's wealth. By 2018, China's GINI index had risen to 0467, according to the World Bank. China was once a world leader in science and technology until the Ming dynasty. The discoveries and inventions of ancient China, such as papermaking, printing, compass, and gunpowder (the four great inventions of ancient China), spread to East Asia, the Middle East, and later to Europe. Chinese mathematicians first used negative numbers. By the 17th century, Europe and Western countries had outperformed China in advances in science and technology. The cause of this great divergence in the early modern period continues to be debated by scholars to this day. After repeated military defeats by European colonial forces and Japan in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Western affairs movement. After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the Soviet Union, where scientific research was part of the central program. After Mao Zedong's death in 1976, science and technology was established as one of the four modernizations, and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed. Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has invested heavily in scientific research and is rapidly catching up with the United States in R & D spending. In 2017, China spent $ 279 billion on scientific research and development. According to the OECD, China spent 211% of its GDP on research and development (R & D) in 2016. Science and technology are considered essential to achieving China's economic and political goals, and to some extent they are also referred to as "technical nationalism" and are retained as a source of national pride. Nevertheless, China's investment in basic and applied science research lags behind the investment of major technology powers such as the United States and Japan. According to the US National Science Board, in 2016 China had more science and engineering publications than the United States for the first time. Also, in 2016, China spent $ 409 billion (according to PPP) on research and development. In 2018, China is estimated to spend $ 475 billion (according to PPP) next to the United States. In 2017, China was No. 2 In international patent applications, it is behind the United States, but before Japan. Chinese tech companies Huawei and ZTE were the top two filers of international patents in 2017. Chinese-born scientists have won four Nobel Prizes in Physics, one Nobel Prize in Chemistry and one Nobel Prize in Chemistry or Medicine, but most of these scientists have studied Nobel Prize-winning studies in Western countries. going. China is developing an education system with an emphasis on science, mathematics and engineering. In 2009, China graduated from more than 10,000 PhD engineers and 500,000 Bachelor of Science degrees. This is more than any other country. In 2016, there were 4.7 million STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) graduates in China, more than eight times the corresponding number in the United States. China has also become the world's largest publisher of scientific papers by 2016. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei and Lenovo have become world leaders in telecommunications and personal computing, and Chinese supercomputers have consistently been ranked as one of the most powerful in the world. China is also expanding the use of industrial robots. From 2008 to 2011, the installation of multipurpose robots in factories in China increased by 136%. China has been the world's largest market for industrial robots since 2013, accounting for 45% of newly installed robots between 2019 and 2021. China's space program is one of the most active in the world and is a major source of national pride. In 2018, China successfully launched more satellites (35) than any other country, including the United States (30). In 1970, China launched its first satellite, Dong Fang Hong 1, and became the fifth country to do this independently. In 2003, China became the third country where Yang Liwei's space flight boarded Shenzhou 5 and independently sent humans into space. As of 2015, 10 Chinese, including 2 women, have left for space. In 2011, China's first space station module, Tiangong-1, was launched, making it the first step in a project to assemble a large manned station by the early 2020s. In 2013, China succeeded in landing Chang'e 3 lander and Yutu rover on the moon. In 2016, China's second space station module, Tiangong-2, was launched from the Sake Fountain on the Long March 2 rocket on September 15, 2016. After that, on October 19, 2016, Shenzhou 11 succeeded in docking with Tiangong 2. In 2019, China became the first country to land Chang'e 4 on the other side of the moon. A 2016 report by the McKinsey Consulting Group revealed that China spends more on infrastructure each year than on North America and Western Europe combined. China is the world's largest telecommunications market and currently owns the most active mobile phones in the world, with more than 1.5 billion subscribers as of 2018. It also has the largest number of Internet and broadband users in the world, with more than 800 million Internet users (equivalent to about 60% of the population) as of 2018, almost all of which are also mobile. By 2017, almost the entire population of China has access to 4G networks \\ u200b \\ u200b. By 2018, China has more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of the world total. In terms of the percentage of unique mobile subscribers in the population, China entered the country at 82%, making the country No. Three in the world (as of 2018). As of early 2019, China's average mobile connection speed is 30 Mbit None It is s (megabits / sec), which is 9% slower than the United States. For fixed broadband in China, the average download speed is 76 It was Mbit / s. Also, 60% of fixed broadband Chinese users (or 200 million Chinese households) are 100. Mbit None I was able to access the Internet with s or above (as of 2018). China is 1Gbit / s（1000 Mbit None s) Rapid progress has been made in the Internet, with 42% of Chinese households by 2023 1 Expected to have Gbit / s broadband links. In 2018, China has 378 million fixed broadband users, 87% of which are fiber optic users, and China is No. No. 1 in the world in the development of optical fiber cables for broadband. By the end of 2017, China had 29 million kilometers of fiber optic cable. By 2019, China is expected to account for 24% of global spending on IoT or internet-connected devices. Since 2011, China has been the country with the most communication bandwidth in the world. By 2014, China hosted more than double the domestic bandwidth potential of the United States, a historic leader in terms of installed communications bandwidth (China: United States of America: 13% of the world total). 29%). China is making rapid progress in 5G, and by late 2018, China had launched a large-scale commercial 5G trial. At the beginning of 2019, Shanghai station will have an internet speed of 1,200 Introduced Mbit / s 5G WiFi. China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom are the three major mobile and internet providers in China. China Telecom alone has served more than 145 million broadband subscribers and 300 million mobile users. China Unicom had about 300 million subscribers. And China Mobile, the largest of them, had 925 million users as of 2018. Together, the three operators had over 3.4 million 4G base stations in China. Several Chinese telecommunications companies, especially Huawei and ZTE, have been accused of spying on Chinese troops. British intelligence agencies (GCHQ and NCSC) said in 2019 that there was no evidence of malicious activity or espionage by Huawei. China is developing its own satellite navigation system, Beidou, which began offering commercial navigation services throughout Asia in 2012 and global services by the end of 2018. Currently, China belongs to an elite group of three countries (the United States and Russia are the other two members) that provide global satellite navigation. Since the late 1990s, China's national highway network has expanded significantly through the construction of national highway and highway networks. In 2018, the Chinese highway has a total length of 142,500 Reaching km (88,500 miles), it has become the longest highway system in the world. And by 2017, China's railways reached a total length of 127,000 km. By the end of 2018, China's high-speed rail network will be 29,000 It reaches a length of km and accounts for more than 60% of the world total. In 1991, there were only six bridges across the main part of the Yangtze River, which divides the country into two halves, north and south. By October 2014, there were 81 such bridges and tunnels. China is the world's largest market for automobiles, surpassing the United States in both sales and production of automobiles. In 2016, passenger car sales exceeded 24 million units. The side effect of the rapid growth of China's road network is the significant increase in road accidents, which is cited as a possible cause of inadequate traffic practices. In 2011 alone, about 62,000 Chinese died in road accidents. However, the Chinese government has taken many steps to address this issue, reducing the number of road fatalities by 20% between 2007 and 2017. Bicycles are still a common means of transportation in urban areas, despite the growing popularity of automobiles. As of 2012, there are about 470 million bicycles in China. State-owned Chinese railways are the busiest in the world, with only 6% of the world's railroads processing one-quarter of the world's rail traffic in 2006. As of 2017, there are 127,000 in this country With a km (78,914 miles) railroad, it is the second longest network in the world. Railroads are tense to meet huge demand, especially during the Chinese New Year holidays, when the world's largest annual migration takes place. In 2013, China's railways carried 2,106 million passengers, produced 1,0595.6 billion passenger kilometers, carried 3,967 million tons of cargo, and produced 2,917.4 billion cargo tons. .. China's high-speed rail (HSR) system began construction in the early 2000s. By the end of 2019, China's high-speed rail had more than 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles) of dedicated lines, surpassing the length of two other high-speed rail lines in the world, making it the longest HSR network in the world. With more than 1.1 billion passengers annually in 2015, it is the busiest country in the world. The network includes the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai high-speed rail, the longest HSR line in the world, and the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail, which has three longest railway bridges in the world. HSR truck network will be about 30,000 by the end of 2019 It is set to reach km (19,000 miles). Speed ​​431km per hour (268 The Shanghai Maglev, which reaches mph), is the fastest commercial train in the world. May 2019, 600 in China km None hr（375 We have released a prototype of a linear motor car that reaches speeds of mph). And it is expected to enter commercial production by 2021. Since 2000, the growth of high-speed transportation systems in Chinese cities has accelerated. As of January 2016, 26 cities in China have urban mass transit systems in operation, 39 more have approved metro systems, and by 2020, 12 more cities will be joined. Has been approved. Shanghai Metro, Beijing Subway, Guangzhou Metro, Hong Kong MTR and Shenzhen Metro are the longest and busiest in the world. There are about 229 airports in 2017, and about 240 are planned by 2020. With more than two-thirds of the airports under construction worldwide in 2013 in China, Boeing predicts that China's fleet of active commercial aircraft in China will increase from 1,910 in 2011 to 5,980 in 2031. doing. In just five years from 2013 to 2018, China bought 1000 planes from Boeing. With the rapid expansion of civil aviation, China's largest airport has also become one of the busiest airports in the world. In 2018, Beijing Capital Airport was ranked second in the world in terms of passenger traffic (26th in 2002). Since 2010, Hong Kong International Airport and Shanghai Pudong International Airport have been ranked 1st and 3rd in tonnage of air cargo. Approximately 80% of China's airspace remains restricted in military use, with Chinese airlines accounting for eight out of ten Asian airlines in terms of delays. In 2017, the ports of Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Ningbo-san, Guangzhou, Qingdao and Tianjin ranked in the top 10 in the world in terms of container volume and tonnage. China's water and sanitation infrastructure faces challenges such as rapid urbanization, water scarcity, pollution and pollution. According to data presented by WHO and UNICEF's Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation in 2015, about 36% of China's rural population still did not have access to improved sanitation. In June 2010, there were 1,519 sewage treatment facilities in China, with 18 additional facilities added each week. The ongoing North-South water migration project aims to alleviate water shortages in the north. According to the 2010 census, the population of the People's Republic of China is recorded to be about 1,370,536,875. About 1660% of the population was under 14 years old, 7014% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 1326% were over 60 years old. The population growth rate in 2013 is estimated to be 046%. China once made up the majority of the world's poor. It now occupies most of the middle class in the world. Although a middle-income country by Western standards, China's rapid growth has brought hundreds of millions, or more precisely 800 million, out of poverty since 1978. By 2013, less than 2% of China's population lived below the US $ 19 per day international poverty line, up from 88% in 1981. China's own poverty standards are higher, yet China is on the road to completely eradicating national poverty by 2019. From 2009 to 2018, China's unemployment rate averaged around 4%. Considering concerns about population growth, China enforced a limit of two children in the 1970s and in 1979 began advocating a stricter limit of one child per family. However, from the mid-1980s, given the unpopularity of strict restrictions, China began to allow some major exemptions, especially in rural areas, in fact "15" from the mid-1980s to 2015. It was a child policy (ethnic minorities were also exempt from the limitation of one child). The next major relaxation of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing a family to have two children if one parent is an only child. In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced and the two-child policy was adopted. According to 2010 census data, the total fertility rate could be around 14, but it could be close to 15-16 due to underreported fertility rates. According to a group of scholars, the limitation of one child had little effect on population growth or the size of the total population. But these scholars have been challenged. Their own counterfactual model of such unrestricted fertility decline means that China avoided more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015. -Children's limits that make up the majority of that reduction. This policy, along with traditional boy preferences, may have contributed to the gender imbalance at birth. According to the 2010 Census, the sex ratio at birth is 11806 boys per 100 girls, which is beyond the normal range of about 105 boys per 100 girls. A 2010 census found that men make up 5127 percent of the total population. However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when men made up 5182 percent of the total population. China legally recognizes 56 different ethnic groups. The largest of these nationalities are Chinese or "Han", who make up more than 80% of the total population. The Han Chinese, the world's largest monoethnic group, outperforms other ethnic groups in all state-level sectors except Tibet and Xinjiang. According to the 2010 Census, ethnic minorities make up less than about 25% of China's population. Compared to the 2000 census, the Han Chinese population increased by 66,537,177 (574%) and the 55 ethnic minority population increased by 7,362,627 (692%). The 2010 census recorded a total of 593,832 foreigners living in China. The largest such groups were from South Korea (120,750), the United States (71,493), and Japan (66,159). There are 292 living languages ​​in China. The most commonly spoken languages ​​belong to the Sinitic languages ​​of the Sino-Tibetan tribe, including Mandarin (70% of the population speaks), and other Chinese varieties: Yue. (Including Cantonese and Taiwanese), Wu (including Shanghainese) and Suzhounese), Min (including Fuzhounese, Hokkien, Teochew), Xiang, Gan, Hakka. The languages ​​of the Tibeto-Burman Chapter, including Tibet, Strong, Pear, and Yi, are spoken in Tibet and the Yunnan Plateau. Other ethnic minority languages ​​in southwestern China include the Kra-Dai villas, Thai, Dong, Sui, Miao and Yao of the Monmyao, and Wa of the Austroasiatic. In northeastern and northwestern China, local ethnic groups speak Altaic languages, including Manchu, Mongolian, and some Turkic (Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Salar, and Western Yugur). Korean is spoken natively along the border with North Korea. Sarikoli, a Tajik language in the western part of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is an Indo-European language family. Native Taiwanese, including a small population on the mainland, speak Austronesian. Standard Mandarin, a variety of Mandarin-based mandarins, is the official language of China and is used as a national common language among people of different linguistic backgrounds. Mongolian, Uighur, Tibetan, Zhuang, and various other languages ​​are also globally recognized throughout the country. Chinese characters have been used as Sinitic scripts for thousands of years. They allow speakers of Chinese varieties who do not understand each other to communicate with each other by writing. In 1956, the government introduced Simplified Chinese. It replaced the old Traditional Chinese characters in mainland China. Kanji is romanized using the Pinyin system. Tibetan uses an alphabet based on an Indian script. Uyghur is most commonly written in the Persian alphabet-based Uyghur Arabic script. Both the Mongolian and Manchu alphabets used in China are derived from the Old Uyghur alphabet. Zhuang uses both official Latin alphabet scripts and Traditional Chinese character scripts. China has become significantly urbanized in recent decades. The proportion of the population of urban countries has increased from 20% in 1980 to more than 55% in 2016. China's urban population is estimated to reach 1 billion by 2030, which could be one-eighth of the world's population. As of 2012, there are more than 262 million migrant workers in China, most of them rural migrants seeking to work in urban areas. China has more than 160 cities with a population of over 1 million, including seven megacities (Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Shenzhen and Wuhan). Shanghai is the most populous urban area in China, and Chongqing is its largest city. By 2025, it is estimated that there will be 221 cities in the country with more than 1 million inhabitants. The numbers in the table below are from the 2010 Census and are only estimates of the urban population within the range of administrative cities. Considering the total population of local governments (including suburban and rural populations), there are different rankings. Due to the large “floating population” of migrant workers, it is difficult to conduct a census in urban areas. The numbers below include long-term residents only. Since 1986, compulsory education in China has consisted of elementary and junior high schools, which last for a total of nine years. In 2010, about 825% of students continued their education in a three-year high school. Convening a high school, which is an entrance examination for a national university in China, is a prerequisite for admission to most higher education institutions. In 2010, 27% of secondary school graduates were enrolled in higher education. This number has increased significantly over the past few years, reaching 50% of high school enrollments in 2018. Vocational education is available to students at secondary and higher education levels. In February 2006, the government promised to provide a completely free nine-year education, including textbooks and tuition. Annual education investment went from less than $ 50 billion in 2003 to more than $ 250 billion in 2011. However, there is still inequality in education spending. In 2010, the annual cost of education per high school student in Beijing was 20,023 yen, but in Guizhou Province, one of the poorest states in China, it was only 3,204 yen. Free compulsory education in China consists of elementary and junior high schools aged 6 to 15 years. In 2011, about 814% of Chinese received secondary education. By 2007, China had 396,567 primary schools, 94,116 secondary schools and 2,236 higher education institutions. As of 2018, 96% of the population over the age of 15 can read and write. In 1949, only 20% of the population could be read, compared to 655% 30 years later. In 2009, Chinese students in Shanghai were tested by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), a global assessment of academic performance for 15-year-old school students, achieving world-class results in mathematics, science and literacy. Did. Despite the high achievements, China's education also faces domestic and international criticisms of its focus on memorization and the quality gap from rural to urban areas. In recent years, an increasing number of leading international universities are seeking influence in China. Washington University in St. Louis. Louis established the Fudan University and EMBA program in 2002 and has always been ranked as one of the best universities in the world since then. Columbia Global Center Beijing opened in 2009 and Harvard Institute Shanghai opened in 2010. Two years later, Stanford University established an academic center at Peking University. The following year, Duke Kunshan University opened in 2013. Then, in 2014, Yale Center Beijing and NYU Shanghai were established. The National Health and Family Planning Commission, along with local committee responders, oversees the health needs of the Chinese people. Since the early 1950s, the emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized China's health policy. At that time, the Communist Party launched a patriotic health campaign aimed at improving hygiene and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing some illnesses. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, and scarlet fever that were previously prevalent in China have been largely eradicated by the campaign. After Deng Xiaoping began economic reforms in 1978, many of the free public health services provided in the countryside with the People's Commune disappeared, but the health of the Chinese people improved rapidly due to improved nutritional status. Medical care in China has been mostly privatized and the quality has improved significantly. In 2009, the government launched a three-year, large-scale healthcare delivery initiative worth US $ 124 billion. By 2011, as a result of this campaign, 95% of China's population had basic health insurance. In 2011, China was estimated to be the world's third largest supplier of medicines, but its population is struggling to develop and distribute counterfeit medicines. As of 2017, China has a life expectancy of 76 years and an infant mortality rate of 7 per 1,000. Both have improved significantly since the 1950s. The rate of stunting caused by malnutrition dropped from 331% in 1990 to 99% in 2010. Despite significant health improvements and the construction of advanced medical facilities, China has several issues, including respiratory illness due to widespread air pollution, hundreds of millions of smokers, and increased obesity in urban youth. There are new public health issues. China's populous and densely populated cities have experienced serious illnesses in recent years, such as the 2003 SARS outbreak, which has since been largely contained. In 2010, air pollution killed 1.2 million people prematurely in China. The COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed in Wuhan in December 2019. The Chinese government has been criticized for dealing with epidemics and accused of concealing the extent of the outbreak before it became an international pandemic. The Government of the People's Republic of China officially supported state atheism and conducted an anti-religious campaign for this purpose. National religious issues and issues are overseen by the State Administration for Religious Affairs. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Chinese Constitution, but religious groups without official approval may be subject to state persecution. For thousands of years, Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements. The "three religions," including Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism (Chinese Buddhism), have historically played an important role in the formation of Chinese culture, enriching the theological and spiritual framework reminiscent of the Shan and Zhou dynasties. Surrounded by three religions and other traditions, China's popular or folk religion is a character that means "generational energy" that can be the ancestral principle of the god of the environment or a group of humans ( Loyalty to God), the concept of civilization, cultural heroes, many of which appear in Chinese mythology and history. Among the most popular cults are Mazu (Goddess of the Sea), Yellow Emperor (one of the heads of two gods of Chinese race), Guandi (Goddess of War and Business), and Fortune God (of prosperity and affluence). God), Pang, and many others. China is home to many of the world's tallest religious statues, including the Great Buddha of Lushan in Henan Province. Due to the various definitions of "religion" and the unorganized diffusion of Chinese religious traditions, it is difficult to collect clear data on China's religious affiliation. Scholars note that there is no clear line between the three religions and the practice of local folk beliefs in China. Gallup In a 2015 poll conducted by International, 61% of Chinese self-identified as "convincing atheists," but that Chinese religions or parts of them can be defined as nontheistic and humanitarian religions. It is worth paying attention to. I do not believe that God's creativity is completely transcendent, but it is unique to the world, especially humans. According to a 2014 survey, about 74% practice non-religious or Chinese folk beliefs, 16% are Buddhists, 2% are Christians, 1% are Muslims, and 8% are Taoist or folk religions. We adhere to other religions, including. In addition to the local religious practices of the Han Chinese, there are also various ethnic minority groups in China that maintain their traditional religions. Today, various folk beliefs make up 2-3% of the population, but Confucianism as a religious self-identification is common within the intellectual class. Important beliefs that are particularly relevant to a particular ethnic group include Tibetan Buddhism and Islam of the Hui, Uighur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and other peoples of northwestern China. Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been strongly influenced by Confucianism. During much of the country's dynasty, opportunities for social progress can be provided by high performance in the prestigious Imperial Examination, which originated in the Han dynasty. The literary emphasis of the exam influenced the general perception of Chinese cultural sophistication, including the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting are more forms of art than dance and theater. Chinese culture has long emphasized a deep sense of history and a predominantly inward national perspective. Currently, exams and the Order of Culture are very much appreciated in China. The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into a traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the May Fourth Movement and the reformist ideals. They will change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land ownership, sexism, and the Confucian education system, while preserving other aspects such as family structure and culture of obedience to the state. It was made. Some observers see the period after China was founded in 1949 as a continuation of the history of the traditional Chinese dynasty, while others see Communist rule, especially politics such as the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Claiming to have damaged the foundations of Chinese culture through the movement, many aspects of traditional culture have been destroyed and accused of being "regressive and harmful" or "traces of communism." Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts such as Peking Opera, have been modified to comply with the government's policies and publicity at the time. Access to foreign media is still severely restricted. Today, the Chinese government accepts many elements of traditional Chinese culture as an integral part of Chinese society. With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have been actively revived, especially folk art and diversity art, both nationally and globally. I am also interested in it. None China is currently the third most visited country in the world, with 55.7 million foreign visitors in 2010. We have also experienced a huge amount of domestic tourism. In October 2012, an estimated 740 million Chinese vacationers traveled the country. Chinese literature is based on Zhou dynasty literature. The concepts covered in the Chinese classic texts present a wide range of ideas and themes, including calendars, the military, astrology, herbology, geography and many others. Some of the most important early texts include the Four Books and Five Classics, which served as the authoritative book of Confucianism for the state-sponsored curriculum during the dynasty. It is inherited from the classical Chinese poetry that developed into the Floruit during the Tang dynasty. Li Bai and Du Fu opened a turning point in the poetry world through romanticism and realism, respectively. Chinese history began with, and the overall scope of Chinese history tradition is called Twenty-Four History, setting the vast stage of Chinese novels along with Chinese myths and folklore. Boosted by the fast-growing civil class of the Ming dynasty, Chinese classic novels have risen to a boom in history, towns, gods, and demons, as represented by four great classic novels, including ,,,, and. Did. Along with Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng's Wuxia novels, it continues to be a permanent source of popular culture in East Asian cultures. In the wake of the New Culture Movement after the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese literature embarked on a new era with white stories written for the general public. Hu Shih and Lu Xun were pioneers of modern literature. After the Cultural Revolution, various literary genres emerged, including fog poetry, scar literature, young adult fiction, and xungen literature influenced by magical realism. Mo Yan, a literary writer at xungen, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012. Chinese food is very diverse and utilizes thousands of years of culinary history and geographical diversity, including Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, etc. , The most influential dish is known as the "8 major dishes". None All of them are characterized by precise skills in molding, heating, colorways and flavors. Chinese food is also known for its wide range of cooking methods and ingredients, as well as the diet emphasized by traditional herbal medicine. In general, China's staple food is rice in the south and wheat-based bread and noodles in the north. Pre-modern common people's diets were mainly grains and simple vegetables, and meat was reserved for special occasions. And bean products such as tofu and soy milk are still popular sources of protein. Pork is currently the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-quarters of the country's total meat consumption. While pork dominates the meat market, there are also vegetarian Buddhist dishes and Chinese Islamic dishes that do not use pork. Due to the proximity of the sea and the mild climate of the region, Southern cuisine has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables. It differs in many ways from a dry wheat-based diet throughout northern China. Many sects of Chinese cuisine, such as Hong Kong and American Chinese, have emerged in the countries that host the diaspora in China. China has become a major sports destination in the world. The country has won the right to host several major global sports tournaments, including the 2008 Summer Olympics, the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, the 2019 FIBA ​​Basketball World Cup, and the upcoming Winter Olympics in 2022. Did. China has one of the oldest sports cultures in the world. There is evidence that archery () took place during the Western Zhou dynasty. Swordsmanship () and Kemari are sports that are loosely associated with association football, dating back to the early Chinese dynasties. Physical fitness is widely emphasized in Chinese culture, and morning exercises such as qigong and tai chi are widely practiced, and commercial gyms and private fitness clubs are gaining popularity nationwide. Basketball is currently the most popular spectator sport in China. The Chinese Basketball Association and the American Basketball Association highly value Chinese or ethnic players such as Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian, and have gained a lot of support among people. The Chinese Professional Soccer League, now known as the Chinese Super League, was founded in 1994 and is the largest soccer market in Asia. Other popular sports in the country include martial arts, table tennis, badminton, swimming and snooker. Board games such as go (known in Chinese), Xiangqi, Mahjong, and more recently chess are also played at the professional level. In addition, there are a huge number of cyclists in China, with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012. More traditional sports such as dragon boat racing, Mongolian style wrestling and horse racing are also popular. China has only participated as China since 1952, but has participated in the Olympic Games since 1932. China held the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where the athlete won 51 gold medals. This is the most gold medal of the participating countries of the year. China also won the most medals at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, with a total of 231 medals, including 95 gold medals. In 2011, the 2011 Summer Universiade was held in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. China held the 2013 East Asian Games in Tianjin and the 2014 Summer Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing. The first country to host both the regular and youth Olympics. Beijing and the nearby city of Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, will also co-sponsor the 2022 Winter Olympics. As a result, Beijing will be the first in the world to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics. ']
