{5414: ('PARIS  —   France eased its gun rules on Wednesday to allow   police officers to carry their sidearms even if the nation is not in a state of emergency. The move was a response to an attack on Monday in which an Islamic State assailant fatally stabbed a policeman and his companion at their home while their child was there. The eased rules, welcomed by France’s police unions, came as the authorities in Belgium alerted police that more attacks appeared to be in advanced planning stages and could be imminent. A group of extremists have left Syria and divided into smaller groups headed for Belgium and France, the warning said. The information was reported by a Belgian newspaper, La Dernière Heure, which said police had received an alert that “combatants left Syria about a week and a half ago in order to reach Europe via Turkey and Greece, by boat, without passports. ” Belgian counterterrorism officials tried to play down the significance of the warning. The Belgian Coordinating Body for Threat Analysis, which reviews and evaluates intelligence and other   information, did not raise the country’s alert level, and said in a statement that the warning, leaked to the newspaper, “had not been contextualized and, in its current form, has no direct impact on the current threat level. ” Brussels, the capital, was virtually shut down in November after attacks in and around Paris left 130 people dead and the authorities warning of the possibility of an imminent attack in Belgium. Officials did not dispute the authenticity of the new warning, which described the   assailants as armed and poised to strike. Among the possible targets in Belgium were embassies, restaurants, hospitals, hotels, concert halls and pedestrian streets, according to the warning. When pressed about the information, Paul Van Tigchelt, the director of the   body  —   known by its French initials, OCAM, as well as its Flemish initials, OCAD  —   described it as “raw intelligence. ” Raw intelligence generally refers to information that is largely unverified, may originate from a single source and has not yet been corroborated. However, with the Euro 2016 soccer tournament underway in France and drawing huge crowds to city centers and areas around stadiums, the report from Belgium was consistent with assessments by security officials that its neighbor faces a persistent and serious risk. There are already a number of Belgian and French citizens or residents who have fought for the Islamic State or other groups in Syria or Iraq and then returned home, as was the case with a number of people who took part in either the Paris or Brussels attacks. In testimony before Belgium’s Parliament on Wednesday, Justice Minister Koen Geens said that as of June 7, 114 Belgian fighters had returned from the   conflict zone and that seven of them had since died. The number of returnees in France is about 244, one of the top French intelligence officials, Patrick Calvar, told lawmakers last month. French officials did not respond specifically to Belgium’s most recent warning of returning jihadists. But Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France, speaking on France Inter radio Wednesday, made clear that the country must be prepared for more attacks. “Other innocent people will lose their lives,” he said. “You could accuse me of making society even more anxious than it already is, given all the events that have happened. But sadly, this is the reality. ” He was referring not only to the November attacks, but also to the fatal stabbings in France on Monday by an extremist who asserted loyalty to the Islamic State. “This is generational, we have hundreds of individuals who are radicalized,” Mr. Valls said. There was no change to the threat level in France on Wednesday. France has maintained a state of emergency since the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, and considers the risk of attack high. However, French police officers were particularly on edge after stabbings on Monday of an   officer and his companion, an Interior Ministry employee. The country’s police unions met with Interior Ministry officials on Wednesday and emerged saying they had received indefinite permission to carry their work guns, even when off duty. They are permitted to do so now under    provisions, but those will expire on July 26. Many police officers had worried that the expiration would make them more vulnerable. The extended permission for   carrying, given by Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister, is not permanent, but does not have an end date. A far less nervous and combative mood prevailed in Magnanville, the small town west of Paris where the stabbings took place. About 200 people gathered at noon on Wednesday for a moment of silence at the end of the street where the policeman lived with his family. They listened quietly to remarks from the town’s mayor and sang the national anthem, “La Marseillaise. ” Only a few of the mourners complained that France had too many mosques, a   sentiment expressed in parts of France in response to fears of Islamic extremists. Men representing area Muslim groups came to pay their respects, standing a bit apart as if they were outsiders, although they were from neighboring towns. One of them, Abdelaziz El Jaouhari, who is the secretary general for the Council of Muslims for the department of Yvelines, said France needed more proper mosques to help fight radicalism. A department is a local unit of government, similar to a county. “We do not have enough official places of prayer for the community, and it is much better for young people to be in official places of worship rather than with those networks they find in basements and I don’t know where,” Mr. Jaouhari said.', [('new', 3.83), ('police', 2.66), ('don', 2.17), ('time', 1.76), ('know', 1.72), ('officials', 1.61), ('government', 1.56), ('people', 1.55), ('make', 1.41), ('way', 1.39), ('law', 1.37), ('ms', 1.36), ('country', 1.28), ('family', 1.25), ('security', 1.25), ('say', 1.24), ('ve', 1.21), ('officers', 1.18), ('minister', 1.14), ('department', 1.11), ('come', 1.11), ('ago', 1.1), ('did', 1.08), ('attacks', 1.04), ('group', 1.03), ('end', 0.99), ('need', 0.99), ('terrorism', 0.98), ('war', 0.98), ('terror', 0.98), ('state', 0.95), ('better', 0.95), ('work', 0.95), ('left', 0.95), ('case', 0.94), ('authorities', 0.94), ('does', 0.93), ('use', 0.93), ('day', 0.92), ('attack', 0.92), ('help', 0.91), ('groups', 0.9), ('change', 0.89), ('came', 0.87), ('far', 0.84), ('car', 0.83), ('home', 0.82), ('place', 0.82), ('young', 0.81), ('center', 0.81), ('child', 0.79), ('intelligence', 0.79), ('took', 0.79), ('man', 0.78), ('making', 0.76), ('pay', 0.74), ('information', 0.74), ('news', 0.74), ('sports', 0.74), ('area', 0.73), ('told', 0.72), ('office', 0.71), ('ll', 0.69), ('threat', 0.69), ('statement', 0.69), ('official', 0.67), ('old', 0.67), ('clear', 0.67), ('plan', 0.66), ('high', 0.66), ('director', 0.65), ('half', 0.65), ('according', 0.65), ('outside', 0.65), ('saying', 0.65), ('known', 0.64), ('week', 0.64), ('line', 0.63), ('small', 0.63), ('rate', 0.62), ('said', 0.61), ('face', 0.61), ('general', 0.61), ('recent', 0.59), ('given', 0.58), ('particularly', 0.58), ('possible', 0.56), ('moment', 0.55), ('able', 0.54), ('order', 0.53), ('win', 0.52), ('try', 0.52), ('number', 0.52), ('turn', 0.51), ('head', 0.5), ('areas', 0.5), ('hospital', 0.49), ('risk', 0.49), ('play', 0.48), ('community', 0.47), ('current', 0.47), ('lives', 0.47), ('received', 0.46), ('led', 0.45), ('largely', 0.44), ('view', 0.43), ('large', 0.42), ('main', 0.4), ('places', 0.4), ('act', 0.39), ('works', 0.38), ('reality', 0.38), ('standing', 0.37), ('similar', 0.37), ('rules', 0.35), ('review', 0.33), ('eat', 0.32), ('era', 0.32), ('seven', 0.3), ('restaurant', 0.29), ('prepared', 0.26), ('restaurants', 0.22)]), 22975: ('A man wielding an axe has left at least four people injured on a train after going on a rampage and has been shot by police.

Day after day, the officers comb the highest floor of the building, looking for witnesses to point them to the right door and listening for gunshots like those that have echoed all over the world in recent months. They are conducting exercises to help them hunt down an “active shooter. ” “It’s going to happen,” said Chief James R. Waters, who leads the New York Police Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau. “Something like Orlando’s going to happen. ” Last year, the police announced the creation of a heavily armed and armored regiment called the Critical Response Command. Teams of officers work all over the city and are trained to respond to many locations in three to five minutes. They represent a new response to a new threat. Gone are the days when the first officers on a scene set up a perimeter and waited for backup or a   team. The perpetrators of the most recent wave of mass shootings around the world  —   Paris San Bernardino, Calif. Orlando, Fla.  —   were not interested in taking hostages and negotiating. They came to kill for the sake of killing. And these officers are trained to find and stop them. On Thursday, Chief Waters allowed journalists from The New York Times to watch the Critical Response Command train. “This is seven months of work,” he said, standing before a team of officers in bulletproof vests who were cradling Colt M4 semiautomatic rifles. “It’s incredible progress. ” The officers were practicing in a former pharmaceutical factory on Flushing Avenue in the Fort Greene neighborhood. The Police Department is not listed among the building’s tenants, but it has worked there since before the command’s creation. The journalists were allowed to observe the exercises under restrictions. A photographer and videographer were forbidden to document the command as it moved in drills, and a reporter was asked to describe the tactics only in broad strokes. Department leaders believe terrorists study descriptions of police training in preparation for attacks. “The perpetrators in France demonstrated a familiarity with the French response,” Deputy Chief Scott Shanley said, referring to the coordinated attacks in Paris that killed more than 130 people in November. The officers, who also played the roles of gunmen and bystanders, conducted two exercises. The first began with a dispatcher’s call: shots fired in the building. Officers in a patrol car would typically be the first to respond in this situation, and that was the case in the drill. Two officers, clutching pistols, entered the hallway, crouching, one in front and the other behind him with a hand on the first officer’s back. Officers in the command do not know the details of an exercise beforehand. Suddenly, a man ran toward them, screaming for help. The officers ordered him to his knees and asked about the gunman the man pointed down the hall. The officers hurried around a corner. Gunfire rang out. “Shots fired!” the rear officer shouted into his radio, and the pair ran to the sound. A masked gunman, wearing green fatigues in a room with cubicles, opened fire. The officers fired back. Rounds with a chalklike substance, similar to paintballs, struck the gunman. He fell to the floor. The rear officer shouted “Loading! Loading! Loading!” and ejected a spent magazine from his pistol, sliding in a new one. The other officer bent and took the gunman’s pulse. Dead. They called for backup and waited. What followed was an extraordinary show of paramilitary precision and force. New Yorkers have grown accustomed to seeing heavily armed officers standing in subway stations and at city landmarks. They have not seen what journalists were allowed to see on Thursday  —   a response to an   scene from within the scene itself. The door through which the first responding officers had entered crept open again, and a head popped out. Then the entire team emerged, six officers in this case, moving fast in single file, each touching the back of the man before him. They seemed to move as a single organism, like a long black snake darting across the hall to the closest door. There was no hesitation at the door, no peeking inside. The officers burst through and moved in different directions. “A dynamic entry,” Capt. Eugene McCarthy said, watching. “The perpetrator’s processing is disrupted by dynamic entry,” Deputy Chief John O’Connell said, standing beside him. To demonstrate, the command later allowed journalists to stand in an empty room and wait for the team to enter. The silence was startling, unnerving. The officers did not speak as they snaked toward the room. They communicated in pats on the back and hand signals. There was no warning of their arrival. One moment, the room was empty. A heartbeat later, it was filled with the six men and their guns. Traditionally, when officers stormed a room, the first one was known as the “rabbit,” likely drawing the fire of the gunman inside while the second officer took aim at him. With this team, it was as if there were no rabbit  —   the entire team seemed to swarm the room at once. In the exercise, the team joined the first two officers near the dead gunman, until they all heard more gunfire down the hall. The team regrouped into its line and raced toward the shots. The officer in front fired at a gunman, and others behind him stepped out of the line and did the same, and in what seemed like a second, that gunman was down and the drill over. The officers pulled off their helmets, sweating after minutes of intense action. Captain McCarthy stepped forward and ran through a quick review. The officer who played the second gunman praised the speed and accuracy of the officers who shot him. “No    issues,” he said. “Good job. ” An officer who played a victim, with fake blood on his leg, said: “No shots on me. Good job. ” The officers switched roles and prepared to do it again, the details of the drill different this time. The strategy, though, was constant. “Move to the shooter,” Chief Waters said. “You’ll hear it 50 times. Move to the shooter. It’s got to be ingrained. Like muscle memory. ” The Critical Response Command is made up of 525 handpicked officers and superiors who applied and were chosen after a screening process that included   interviews with Chief Waters and others. Their training must override lifelong human instinct. “It goes against all their upbringing,” Chief Waters said. “They have to walk past and run past victims on the ground. Kids crying. They’re grabbing at your legs. ” The training is always evolving with world events. The command recently introduced suicide belts into exercises. Chief Waters declined to elaborate. The visit on Thursday concluded with directions through more hallways to the elevator. There, waiting, one could hear, from behind, more gunfire.', [('new', 4.39), ('police', 3.05), ('like', 2.31), ('time', 2.01), ('know', 1.97), ('killed', 1.93), ('military', 1.79), ('people', 1.78), ('terrorist', 1.73), ('long', 1.63), ('world', 1.61), ('way', 1.59), ('ms', 1.55), ('going', 1.5), ('ve', 1.39), ('life', 1.39), ('officers', 1.35), ('times', 1.35), ('did', 1.24), ('attacks', 1.19), ('group', 1.18), ('year', 1.18), ('got', 1.16), ('terrorism', 1.13), ('point', 1.12), ('war', 1.12), ('terror', 1.12), ('called', 1.11), ('work', 1.08), ('case', 1.08), ('day', 1.05), ('attack', 1.05), ('help', 1.04), ('later', 1.01), ('came', 1.0), ('leaders', 0.98), ('terrorists', 0.97), ('car', 0.95), ('shooting', 0.94), ('took', 0.91), ('man', 0.9), ('killing', 0.89), ('months', 0.87), ('black', 0.85), ('set', 0.83), ('different', 0.83), ('office', 0.81), ('ll', 0.79), ('threat', 0.79), ('near', 0.78), ('issue', 0.77), ('old', 0.77), ('asked', 0.77), ('fact', 0.76), ('past', 0.75), ('high', 0.75), ('star', 0.75), ('likely', 0.74), ('days', 0.74), ('began', 0.74), ('known', 0.74), ('movie', 0.73), ('line', 0.72), ('role', 0.72), ('rate', 0.71), ('said', 0.7), ('open', 0.69), ('building', 0.67), ('recent', 0.67), ('close', 0.67), ('recently', 0.67), ('spent', 0.66), ('issues', 0.65), ('actor', 0.64), ('seen', 0.64), ('moment', 0.63), ('study', 0.63), ('force', 0.63), ('worked', 0.61), ('team', 0.61), ('order', 0.61), ('win', 0.6), ('try', 0.6), ('ways', 0.59), ('taking', 0.59), ('believe', 0.58), ('head', 0.57), ('process', 0.55), ('play', 0.55), ('hand', 0.54), ('led', 0.52), ('moved', 0.52), ('view', 0.5), ('lead', 0.5), ('played', 0.48), ('act', 0.45), ('standing', 0.42), ('similar', 0.42), ('follow', 0.41), ('allowed', 0.39), ('review', 0.38), ('entire', 0.38), ('eat', 0.37), ('seven', 0.34), ('prepared', 0.3), ('wearing', 0.29), ('bringing', 0.23), ('demonstrated', 0.14)]), 48177: ('’  ’ ’   His spacious house and lawn in the northern Mexican city of   Ciudad Victoria are surrounded by tall walls, and stand in a   gated community with more high fences and security guards. ’ ”   But even here, sitting on his couch surrounded by family photos   and Catholic imagery, this owner of a big business still doesn’t   feel safe. ” ’   ”Nobody trusts anyone,” he said. ”This house, 10 years ago, it   didn’’t have a fence. All the neighbors’’ kids used to come play   here.” ’ ’   But just in the past year, the businessman said, he has attended   the funerals of four murdered close friends. He said he has also   sent all his children to live in safer places. Like almost   everybody you talk to in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas,   the businessman will only discuss security issues if his name is   kept out of print, for fear of reprisals by criminals. ’ ”   Tamaulipas, just over the border from Texas, has been central to   the government’s efforts to contain   cartels,   ever since   Felipe Calderón launched a major     strategy against organized crime nearly a decade   ago. His successor Enrique Peña Nieto is continuing that   approach. ” ”   A particularly intense offensive against the notoriously bloody   Zetas cartel, based in the state, successfully took down most of   the group’s leaders between 2012 and 2015. But putting these   infamous criminal bosses in prison, or in the ground, has done   little to make the state safer. In fact, residents of Ciudad   Victoria, the state capital, say things have never been this bad   in Tamaulipas, as factions of the Zetas fight to fill the vacuums   the government’s strategy has left. ” ’   How bad things are was driven home in March when a   narcomanta  —   a banner left in a public place with a   message from the cartels  —   claimed that one faction of the Zetas   would begin killing civilians if the government did not halt   extradition proceedings against two incarcerated leaders. Since   then, other narcomantas have reiterated the threat, and   murders have increased. ’ ’   ”The way of life has changed completely here in Victoria,” said a     owner, in a hushed voice. Nervous about talking in   a public place, he asked to move to a secure location. ”It’’s   worse than it’’s ever been.” ’ ’  ’ ’   The man admitted he pays protection fees to local cartels so they   leave his business alone, but he still lives in fear. The family   keeps in constant contact via a WhatsApp group at all times, with   all its members noting where they are going, with whom, and when   they will arrive. They are are all too aware of what can happen.   The man said one of his uncles was killed by the Zetas in 2015   for no apparent reason. ’ ’   ”They arrived at his house, armed, pulled him out, took him away,   and later killed him,” he said. ”Why? Who knows.” ’ ”   The number of murders in Mexico surged in the first few years of   Calderón’s offensive against the cartels, and then dropped off   somewhat at the end of his   term and during the first   couple of years of President Peña Nieto’s government. But now the   killing is getting worse again. According to official figures   there were 10, 301 murders between January and June this year.   This was 15 percent more than the number killed during the same   period in 2015, though the average of 57 murders a day is still   10 percent lower than it was when they reached a peak in 2011. ” ’   Many of the worst atrocities over the decade have come at the   hands of the Zetas in Tamaulipas, such as the 2010 massacre of 72   unarmed,   and helpless Central American migrants   in the town of San Fernando. ’ ’   The Zetas formed in the state in the late 1990s, when deserters   from Mexican military and police units were recruited by the then   leader of the Gulf Cartel, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, to be his   personal bodyguards. They were led by Arturo Guzmán Decena, alias     whom the military killed in 2002. ’ ’  ’ ’   There are many origin stories attached to the cartel’’s name. One   of the more common cites the idea that nothing comes after the Z.   The name instills so much fear that there are parts of the   country with heavy Zeta influence where the population avoids   saying it out loud, preferring phrases such as ”those of the last   letter.” ’ ’   Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, known as   oversaw the rise of that   reputation after he took over from   and led the group towards   increasing independence from the Gulf cartel. ’ ”   In 2010, a   split triggered one of the worst turf wars   in all of Mexico, with many of the biggest battles fought in   Tamaulipas. That, in turn, prompted an especially focused     effort to take down the Zetas’ leaders. ” ’   The Mexican Navy killed   in 2012. This left the cartel in the   charge of Miguel Treviño Morales, aka  . When he was arrested   in 2013, power passed to his brother, Omar Treviño Morales, or    . His capture in 2015 is widely blamed for the current   internal split that triggered the current wave of violence in   Ciudad Victoria, where the Zetas have traditionally maintained   particularly tight control over both criminal activity and the   local authorities. ’ ’   ”One group wants to control Victoria, and the other doesn’’t want   to let it go,” said a Tamaulipas state police officer, born and   raised in Ciudad Victoria, who previously served in the Mexican   military. ”Before they answered to one jefe, one   patrón.” ’ ”   The state police officer, who also asked for anonymity for fear   of reprisals, identified one of the warring Zetas factions as the   Cartel del Noroeste, or the Northeastern cartel, which   is allegedly led by Kiki, also known as Kiko, Treviño, a nephew   of   and  . The other is named Grupo   Bravo, also known as Vieja Escuela Z  —   old school   Zetas. The names may give the impression that the fight is   between old and new leaders, but the rivalry has more to do with   the groups’ different territorial bastions and the lack of major   figures to keep them together. ” ’  ’ ’   ”What’’s happening, it’’s like ants,” the cop said of the     kingpin strategy at the heart of the offensive launched by   Calderón in 2006 and continued by Peña Nieto. He said that when   you exterminate the ”queen ant” and don’’t follow up, the insects   regroup and return to their anthill  —   either that, or others take   the queen’’s place. ’ ”   The result in Ciudad Victoria, he added, was that he has never   before felt as afraid for his friends and family as he does now,   with the cartel’s broadcast threats to kill civilians. ” ’   ”It’’s terrorism, in all senses of the word,” he said. ’ ’   The March manta threatening to kill random civilians   unless extradition proceedings against the Treviño brothers were   stopped summed up the way the kingpin strategy has failed the   people of Ciudad Victoria. ’ ’   While the United States and Mexican government celebrate captures   and extraditions of   capos, there’’s no shortage of     gangsters ready to take their place and hang poorly   written letters to presidents. The March manta named, in   badly ungrammatical Spanish, the young nephew Kiko as the   ”lider maximo,” who has made it clear he’’s ready to   murder for his demands. ’ ’   That ominous threat did not appear in local newspapers. It spread   through social media, or by word of mouth, in Ciudad Victoria.   Journalists are too afraid to print it. ’ ’   ”It’’s very frustrating,” said a reporter for a local Tamaulipas   newspaper. ’ ’  ’ ’   The paper, she said, has stayed away from printing     stories ever since the violence escalated after   the   cartel split in 2010. At the moment, she said, her   paper barely reports on the state government briefings detailing   the numbers and locations of people killed. She added that in the   gruesome photographs of the same incidents that are often posted   online, there are often more bodies than the officials say in   those briefings. ’ ’   ”People wanted to know why we weren’’t publishing and telling the   truth about what’’s happening,” she said. ”It wasn’’t because we   didn’’t want to publish what we knew. It just wasn’’t worth our   lives.” ’ ’   The reporter said it would have been tantamount to suicide to try   and find out why gunmen killed 11 members of a single family  —     four children, five women, two men, and the family dog  —   in July.   One of the women and her two children were US citizens visiting   family in Ciudad Victoria. Eight other people were killed and 24   others injured by gunfire on that same weekend. ’ ”The Northeastern cartel claimed responsibility   for the massacre in a manta signed by  . The text   claimed the massacre was retaliation for governor Egidio Torre   Cantu’s failure to provide the protection that came with   accepting cartel bribes. ” ’   ”Please come pick up the dead civilians that I left for you,” the   manta mocked. ”I will continue ordering attacks on the   civilian population in Ciudad Victoria.” ’ ’   Days later gunmen killed five members of another family in Ciudad   Victoria. Authorities encountered the   bodies of the   grandmother, mother, her two sons, and her    baby   girl. ’ ’  ’ ’   A teacher in Ciudad Victoria claimed one of the murdered children   was a student in the middle school where he works, although not   in his class. He said his students, aged 13 to 15, struggle under   the constant pressure of the violence, as well as recruitment   drives by the criminal groups. ’ ’   The teacher said that sometimes he has trouble getting to work   because of the danger on the streets. Once at the school, he   said, he worries that some of the students are working for the   cartels. ’ ’   ”The problem is that you can’’t be strict, you’’re afraid of the   student,” he said. ”Because you don’’t know who they are, or their   parents, or their neighbors.” ’ ’   The deep distrust that permeates the city means many avoid going   out after dark, and everybody watches what they say in all but   the tightest social circles. ’ ’   ”We’’re up against the wall in a really complicated situation,”   said the businessman with the gated house, blaming the current   wave of violence on the ”power vacuum” created by recent   governorship elections that had weakened existing corruption   deals and created an opportunity for outside groups to attempt an   invasion. ’ ’   Not that he sees any way out of such deals. He said he was just   holding on to the hope that such political collusion could be   negotiated without damaging the civilian population, and chuckled   at the idea that any government could make Tamaulipas    . ’ ’   ”All of us are hopeful that the new government will have a good   arrangement with one of the groups of bad guys,” he said, ”so   that the cartels let us work and let us live.” ’', [('new', 2.7), ('police', 1.88), ('don', 1.53), ('years', 1.51), ('like', 1.42), ('time', 1.24), ('just', 1.23), ('know', 1.21), ('killed', 1.19), ('officials', 1.14), ('military', 1.11), ('government', 1.11), ('people', 1.1), ('really', 1.04), ('want', 1.02), ('make', 0.99), ('way', 0.98), ('law', 0.97), ('ms', 0.96), ('president', 0.94), ('going', 0.93), ('country', 0.9), ('children', 0.89), ('family', 0.89), ('security', 0.88), ('good', 0.88), ('say', 0.87), ('things', 0.87), ('house', 0.87), ('political', 0.86), ('ve', 0.86), ('life', 0.86), ('times', 0.83), ('public', 0.81), ('mother', 0.79), ('come', 0.78), ('ago', 0.78), ('did', 0.76), ('didn', 0.75), ('attacks', 0.73), ('group', 0.73), ('year', 0.72), ('got', 0.72), ('criminal', 0.71), ('little', 0.71), ('used', 0.7), ('end', 0.7), ('terrorism', 0.69), ('war', 0.69), ('power', 0.69), ('terror', 0.69), ('percent', 0.68), ('state', 0.67), ('work', 0.67), ('left', 0.67), ('business', 0.66), ('authorities', 0.66), ('does', 0.66), ('use', 0.66), ('arrested', 0.65), ('day', 0.65), ('attack', 0.65), ('help', 0.64), ('groups', 0.64), ('media', 0.63), ('change', 0.63), ('later', 0.62), ('came', 0.62), ('leaders', 0.6), ('big', 0.59), ('away', 0.59), ('car', 0.58), ('home', 0.58), ('place', 0.58), ('young', 0.57), ('parents', 0.56), ('child', 0.56), ('early', 0.56), ('took', 0.56), ('man', 0.55), ('killing', 0.55), ('school', 0.55), ('increase', 0.55), ('violence', 0.54), ('pay', 0.53), ('news', 0.52), ('different', 0.51), ('office', 0.5), ('nearly', 0.49), ('ll', 0.49), ('threat', 0.49), ('near', 0.48), ('students', 0.48), ('issue', 0.48), ('especially', 0.48), ('official', 0.48), ('old', 0.47), ('asked', 0.47), ('clear', 0.47), ('fact', 0.47), ('past', 0.46), ('high', 0.46), ('outside', 0.46), ('saying', 0.46), ('known', 0.45), ('week', 0.45), ('members', 0.45), ('line', 0.44), ('rate', 0.43), ('said', 0.43), ('recent', 0.41), ('close', 0.41), ('particularly', 0.41), ('issues', 0.4), ('effort', 0.4), ('working', 0.39), ('moment', 0.39), ('control', 0.39), ('leave', 0.38), ('order', 0.37), ('major', 0.37), ('felt', 0.37), ('try', 0.37), ('number', 0.37), ('north', 0.37), ('turn', 0.36), ('hands', 0.35), ('numbers', 0.34), ('based', 0.34), ('play', 0.34), ('approach', 0.34), ('community', 0.33), ('alleged', 0.33), ('current', 0.33), ('hand', 0.33), ('lives', 0.33), ('member', 0.33), ('led', 0.32), ('social', 0.32), ('hope', 0.31), ('border', 0.31), ('reason', 0.31), ('lead', 0.31), ('ban', 0.3), ('create', 0.29), ('student', 0.29), ('main', 0.28), ('places', 0.28), ('wants', 0.28), ('personal', 0.28), ('act', 0.28), ('means', 0.27), ('works', 0.27), ('result', 0.27), ('answer', 0.27), ('follow', 0.26), ('signed', 0.25), ('deep', 0.24), ('hold', 0.24), ('word', 0.23), ('eat', 0.23), ('era', 0.22), ('focused', 0.22), ('battle', 0.21), ('figure', 0.21), ('changed', 0.2), ('worse', 0.18)]), 3432: ('DALLAS  —   For two years, Dakota Leierer has worked   shifts in the oil fields of West Texas, sleeping in trailers and driving four hours to see his wife and two young children. But on July 7, when a gunman killed five police officers in Dallas, Mr. Leierer decided he needed to make a change. He wanted to become a Dallas officer. “Everything going on around the world  —   the crises, communities not really getting along with each other, the protests,” Mr. Leierer, 22, said. “It just kind of hit me. ” Relations between the police and the public are especially raw right now, crackling with political and racial tensions. Still, the deaths of eight law enforcement officers in Texas and Louisiana in the last month have generated a few bridges across the divide, with officers across the country reporting gestures of kindness  —   coffee and meals bought for them, and spontaneous offers of thanks and prayers. The attack on the Dallas police produced another result: a surge of interest in joining their ranks. Mr. Leierer, whose family lives about an hour outside Dallas, submitted an application the day after the ambush. His was one of 467 applications that poured into the Dallas Police Department in the two weeks after the shooting, more than three times the number during a similar period a month earlier. Police officials said applications were still coming in, giving the force of 3, 500 a    pool of applicants to fill a class at a police academy that has in recent months struggled to find recruits. For some, an announcement that the city was hiring police officers presented an opportunity for a steady job, with benefits, albeit one with modest pay, shifting hours and risks. But to city and police officials, the flood of applications and phone calls from   recruits was a sign of resilience and support, as if hundreds of people, horrified by the targeted attack on police officers, were rallying to offer backup. “Our police officers ran toward the event,” Mayor Mike Rawlings said. “And that’s what young men and women are doing  —   they’re running toward this, and following those officers who died. That’s a great honor to their lives. ” Deputy Chief Jeff Cotner, who oversees police training, said the increase in applications demonstrated the adage about picking yourself up when you get knocked down. It was a theme seized on by Hillary Clinton, who said in her nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention last week that the increase in applicants to the Dallas force showed “how Americans answer when the call for help goes out. ” The reaction comes at a particularly tense time for the police. Killings of police officers are 8 percent higher than a year ago, with a 78 percent increase in   officer fatalities, including   killings like those in Dallas. In his speech last month at the Republican National Convention, Donald J. Trump said that “America was shocked to its core” over the shootings in Dallas and a   other states. Some of the applicants said they were signing up because they wanted to help the police. Others said they wanted to serve in neighborhoods where police shootings of unarmed black men have hardened years of anger and distrust. They admitted they were stepping into policing at an anguished moment. “A lot of people said: ‘I don’t want you to go into policing. Can’t you find something else to do? ’” said Jamile Owens, 29, who is   and had applied to the Dallas department about a month before the shooting. The increase in applications was prompted by a call to the public from Chief David O. Brown, who stepped in front of the microphones four days after the shooting and spoke candidly about the challenges of police work and the department’s needs. “We’re hiring,” Chief Brown said. “Get off that protest line and put an application in. And we’ll put you in your neighborhood, and we will help you resolve some of the problems you’re protesting about. ” The surge in interest could turn out to be a blip, the same way military enlistments rose modestly  after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, only to weaken during the two wars that followed. For years, police and sheriff’s departments across the country have struggled to find qualified recruits  —   female and minority candidates in particular  —   for jobs that may not seem worth the promise of pensions and good benefits. In the wake of protests and news media scrutiny over the police shootings of black men in places like Ferguson, Mo. Minnesota and Louisiana, police officials say persuading civilians to sign up to wear a police uniform has gotten even harder. “Who wants to work in that type of environment?” Chief Cotner said. “It’s an unattractive occupation, and you’ve got to really truly be passionate about what you’re doing. ” The Dallas police have struggled on two fronts: to find enough recruits for a police academy class and to keep officers from migrating to   police forces. Dallas officers earn a starting salary of $44, 658, according to the department’s website, about $10, 000 less than some nearby police departments pay. For the moment, it appears that the applicants are drawn by the distress. Police departments near Dallas say their application numbers have not risen in recent weeks. More people are applying to join the Police Department in Baton Rouge, La. where three officers were fatally shot 10 days after the Dallas attack, but the police there did not know how many additional applications they had received. The Dallas department said it did not yet have a clear idea of the race, sex or ethnicity of its applicants. Mayor Rawlings said Dallas, the nation’s   city, had a huge need for officers. “We need an excess,” he said. “We don’t know if it’s 200 or 300 or 400, but it’s a lot over this next year. ” Most of the 467 people who leapt to apply and take the Civil Service exam  —   the first step toward being hired  —   will probably never wear a Dallas police badge. The department says it hires only about 15 percent of the applicants who make it through a monthslong gantlet of background checks, fitness tests, polygraph tests and interviews. Jaiston Sawyer, 30, a security guard, said he felt as though Chief Brown’s exhortation had been aimed squarely at him. Although he is an opinionated   user, Mr. Sawyer said, after the Dallas attack merely posting a response seemed too trivial. He said he had applied to join the police in his hometown, Denton, northwest of Dallas, and was planning to apply to Dallas as well. “Nothing ever comes from it when you’re online or trying to protest,” said Mr. Sawyer, who first described his decision to Fox 4 News in Dallas. “That doesn’t make a difference as opposed to actually putting on the suit. ” Mr. Sawyer’s mother, Terri, said she was terrified at first, the memory of police funerals and the siege in downtown Dallas still fresh. She and Mr. Sawyer’s girlfriend worry about his safety. They have asked him: Why now? “I wanted to have an actual role,” said Mr. Sawyer, who is black. “I decided to jump in. ” Mr. Leierer, the oil worker, has been getting ready to take the Civil Service exam on Aug. 19. He does   and situps in an empty storage tank that serves as his oil field office. He has been   on his family’s land. “I was scared at first,” his wife, Samantha, said. “All I hear is all the police officers being shot. But I’ve gotten used to it. ” The other day, Mr. Leierer, who is white, went for a     with a friend who is a sheriff’s deputy in his hometown, Weatherford. They responded to a 911 caller who had hung up, to someone irate about a bicycle in the yard and to a domestic abuse call where they met a woman with two black eyes who did not want to make a report. If he makes it through the months of trainings and screenings, the job as a   Dallas officer will pay almost $15, 000 a year less than what he earns in the oil fields, Mr. Leierer said. But he almost died a year ago when he grabbed a live power line, and he said he wanted a change. “It’s more than just about backing the blue,” he said. “It’s about making real change in the community, just being a leader and trying to help the community as best you can. They definitely need everything they can get. ”', [('new', 3.05), ('police', 2.12), ('don', 1.72), ('years', 1.7), ('like', 1.6), ('candidate', 1.42), ('time', 1.4), ('just', 1.39), ('know', 1.37), ('killed', 1.34), ('officials', 1.29), ('military', 1.25), ('people', 1.24), ('really', 1.17), ('want', 1.14), ('long', 1.14), ('make', 1.12), ('world', 1.12), ('way', 1.1), ('law', 1.09), ('ms', 1.08), ('going', 1.04), ('country', 1.02), ('children', 1.0), ('family', 1.0), ('security', 0.99), ('good', 0.99), ('states', 0.98), ('say', 0.98), ('political', 0.97), ('ve', 0.97), ('officers', 0.94), ('times', 0.94), ('public', 0.91), ('mother', 0.89), ('department', 0.88), ('come', 0.88), ('ago', 0.87), ('did', 0.86), ('lot', 0.84), ('attacks', 0.83), ('year', 0.82), ('got', 0.81), ('used', 0.79), ('including', 0.79), ('end', 0.79), ('need', 0.78), ('war', 0.78), ('power', 0.78), ('percent', 0.77), ('state', 0.76), ('work', 0.75), ('does', 0.74), ('use', 0.74), ('death', 0.74), ('day', 0.73), ('attack', 0.73), ('help', 0.72), ('forces', 0.71), ('media', 0.71), ('change', 0.71), ('jobs', 0.69), ('car', 0.66), ('shooting', 0.65), ('home', 0.65), ('place', 0.65), ('young', 0.65), ('child', 0.63), ('man', 0.62), ('killing', 0.62), ('increase', 0.61), ('best', 0.61), ('making', 0.6), ('months', 0.6), ('black', 0.59), ('pay', 0.59), ('news', 0.59), ('speech', 0.58), ('great', 0.57), ('office', 0.57), ('went', 0.55), ('ll', 0.55), ('near', 0.54), ('white', 0.54), ('especially', 0.54), ('official', 0.54), ('asked', 0.53), ('clear', 0.53), ('plan', 0.53), ('high', 0.52), ('star', 0.52), ('according', 0.52), ('outside', 0.51), ('days', 0.51), ('week', 0.51), ('line', 0.5), ('role', 0.5), ('higher', 0.5), ('rate', 0.49), ('said', 0.48), ('decision', 0.48), ('recent', 0.47), ('particularly', 0.46), ('trying', 0.46), ('makes', 0.45), ('moment', 0.44), ('force', 0.44), ('weeks', 0.43), ('worked', 0.43), ('win', 0.41), ('felt', 0.41), ('try', 0.41), ('number', 0.41), ('north', 0.41), ('turn', 0.4), ('nearby', 0.4), ('calls', 0.39), ('protest', 0.39), ('risk', 0.39), ('numbers', 0.38), ('hours', 0.38), ('community', 0.38), ('lives', 0.37), ('received', 0.36), ('led', 0.36), ('view', 0.35), ('lead', 0.35), ('problems', 0.32), ('places', 0.32), ('wants', 0.31), ('act', 0.31), ('result', 0.3), ('answer', 0.3), ('similar', 0.29), ('follow', 0.29), ('eat', 0.26), ('era', 0.25), ('demonstrated', 0.1)]), 3444: ('Yuko Takamatsu was somewhere in the sea off the coast of Japan. Two and a half years had passed since the tsunami, and no one had found her but no one was really looking, either, except her husband, Yasuo Takamatsu, who loved her very much. Takamatsu first searched on land, at the bank where she vanished, and along the beaches of Onagawa, and in the forests in the mountains. After two and half years, in September 2013, when he still hadn’t found her, he turned to the sea. He contacted the local dive shop, High Bridge, to ask about lessons. The dive instructor, Masayoshi Takahashi, led volunteers on dives to clean up tsunami debris along the coastline. Takahashi and his team had encountered bodies locked inside cars or drifting through the water. Takamatsu felt sure Takahashi would be the one to help him find Yuko. On the phone, he said, “Let’s just meet and talk about it. ” At the shop, he confessed his plan. “At the age of 56,” he said, “the reason I’m actually interested in learning to dive is that I’m trying to find my wife in the sea. ” Takahashi kept maps and records of Takamatsu’s searches, recording which shore and what depth. Sometimes the men searched the same region several times, because bodies and debris moved around in the currents. The shape of each search was different: circular, semicircular, a straight sweep though a current. Now and then Takamatsu had an intuition that his wife was in one part of the sea or another, and Takahashi tried to accommodate his hopes. But there were many restricted areas  —   fishing routes, places with dangerous currents  —   and Takahashi had to coordinate each dive with the coast guard and fishermen. On the first dive, Takamatsu took a boat out to sea. He was scared. The water wasn’t clear, and he knew that below the surface, there were dangers  —   he could get caught by a rope or cut by debris. A flipper might hit his head and flood his mask. The regulator might not work. He might panic. He could die of hypothermia, entanglement, the bends. For his first dive, he reached a depth of 16 feet. He had expected silence, but the ocean had a sound. Takamatsu called it chirichiri  —   the sound of hair burning or a snake hissing. Takahashi instructed him not to touch the bottom with his hands or fins because he might kick up a disorienting cloud of sand. Takamatsu kept his head down and flippers up. One day, Takamatsu visited the home of Masaaki Narita, a    manager at a   plant, who lost his    daughter, Emi, to the tsunami. She was an employee with Yuko at the Onagawa branch of 77 Bank, a regional bank based in Sendai. The women had evacuated to the bank’s roof, but the wave swept them away. Takamatsu felt sorry for Narita’s loss and offered to look for Emi in the sea, too. But Narita decided he would rather dive for the body of his daughter himself. In February 2014, Takamatsu introduced Narita to Takahashi. A heavy rain began the morning I watched Takahashi prepare Narita for a dive. It was January 2016, a warm winter, and the flowers were blooming. Narita had arrived to the shop late, in blue clogs and khaki wind pants. He stood in the corner and tucked his hands under his armpits. He looked at the floor. The room was filled with white orchids. It smelled like pine. Takahashi checked oxygen tanks and pulled wet suits off the drying rack.   in the shop read “Dive Into Your Life. ” A box stacked with diving brochures read “Onagawa, Land of Dreams. ” We drove to a beach called Takenoura, just east of Onagawa’s main port. Narita unloaded his gear. The ground was covered in cracked oyster shells, bathroom tiles, porcelain bowls. Fishing ropes hung like nooses from pine trees, and orange buoys clotted the branches. Narita hoisted the oxygen tank onto his back and wobbled. He tightened his flippers. His wife, Hiromi Narita, paced the loading dock. She climbed barrels of   oyster shells and lifted her hand to the sun like a visor. She watched all her husband’s dives because she worried about him. The ocean was dangerous, and she didn’t want to lose him, too. “If I die, throw my ashes in the sea,” he said. He walked down the boat ramp, snorkeled to deep water and made the descent. On weekends, Hiromi prepared special lunchboxes for Emi that she would deliver into the sea on Sunday. They were packed with Emi’s favorite meals, things like pork soup, Salisbury steak,   shrimp, all in special boxes that decomposed. She tossed the boxes off boat ramps, piers or rock ledges or set them gently adrift on the water. Always someplace hidden, where no one would see her. She had done this for five years. But in the year after the tsunami, when the family relocated to Ishinomaki, a city 30 minutes away, she and her husband did this every day, leaving the house at 5 in the morning to deliver lunch in Onagawa before the workday began.   minutes passed, and Narita resurfaced in the glittering water. He was alive, mouthpiece unhinged, breathing. Hiromi walked to her car and drove off. It was time to deliver rice balls and   chicken. “You will do anything for your child,” she said. Takamatsu met Yuko in 1988, when Yuko was 25 and an employee at the 77 Bank in Onagawa. Takamatsu was a soldier in Japan’s Ground   Force and his boss introduced them. They fell in love right away, Takamatsu said. He described her as gentle. He liked her smile, her modesty. She listened to classical music and painted watercolors on canvasses she showed no one but him. On Friday, March 11, 2011, the day of the tsunami, Takamatsu drove Yuko to the bank. It was on the waterfront, at Onagawa’s main port. Later that morning, he drove his    to the hospital in Ishinomaki. Takamatsu was in the entranceway of the hospital, on his way out the door, when the   earthquake hit. The shaking lasted for six minutes. Traffic lights went down. Takamatsu made his way back to Onagawa on old farming roads and listened to the radio for news of a tsunami. He received a message from the University of Sendai about his son, that he was alive, but he couldn’t reach Yuko or his daughter, a   student in Ishinomaki. Finally, at 3:21, he received a text from Yuko: “Are you O. K.? I want to go home. ” Takamatsu thought that Yuko would have evacuated to a hospital on Mount Horikiri, about 800 feet from the bank. It was high up on a hill, one of many that surrounded Onagawa, and a designated evacuation point for the town. But Takamatsu couldn’t get there. Firefighters blocked the road that led to the hospital. A house was in flames on the hillside. He had no way to reach Yuko, so he went home. She had been lost once before, he told me, on one of their first dates, when Takamatsu took her to a shrine on New Year’s Eve. He told her not to get lost in the crowd, but she did anyway, for 20 minutes, until he found her again in the flow of exiting people. He would never forget those 20 minutes. Takamatsu returned to the hospital in the morning. “I’m here to look for my wife,” he told the nurses. A hospital worker asked him to write down his name on the back of a calendar. He asked if anyone knew what happened to the bank employees. Many people in the hospital had witnessed their fate  —   their screams, their arms extended  —   but no one said anything. Finally a woman told Takamatsu that she had heard that some of the employees were wiped off the roof. She was certain they didn’t make it. “But I don’t know about Yuko,” she added. Takamatsu didn’t think she was dead. He went to every floor of the hospital, and when he couldn’t find her there, he walked to the gymnasium, the elementary school, the hotels  —   all the designated evacuation points. On this search, he ran into many friends and neighbors, and from them he learned that his daughter was safe. Still, no one had seen Yuko. It snowed the day of the tsunami. The sky was leaden, almost black, and the wind was strong between the high cliffs surrounding Onagawa Bay. The wave was expected to sweep in from the ocean at a height of 10 feet. When it first reached the shore at 3:20 p. m. it was surging as high as 45 feet. As it retreated, the buildings in town began to crack and slide under its weight. The water was so cold that survivors crawled toward the hospital but died of hypothermia on the way. Elderly victims died of the cold even after they arrived to safety. Soldiers from the Ground   Force arrived at Onagawa, and the morning after the tsunami they began poking the debris for bodies. They used long poles  —   in places the debris was 15 feet deep. They wrapped the bodies in blankets and left them on the streets until they could return to collect them. All told, 613 bodies have been identified, many elderly who were discovered entombed in their homes. Takamatsu had retired from the Ground   Force he was supposed to begin working as a bus driver that June. Until then, he searched for Yuko every day from morning till evening. Beginning in June, he searched on weekends. On one of his first searches, he made his way by foot to the bank. He traveled carefully across a field of debris. Trains lay twisted on the hillside. A car dangled from a   window. A light pole bent down 90 degrees. Seemingly only the Marine Pal, a fish market, was still standing. The police station was on its side. He stood outside the building. It was nothing now, just a frame, gutted of everything. Sometimes Takamatsu walked alongside the soldiers and listened as they spoke over  . If they announced the discovery of a body, he would walk over to them to ask what the body was wearing. Yuko was wearing black trousers and a   coat. Even though he was searching for Yuko’s body, he was always relieved when it wasn’t hers. A month after the tsunami, when the bank was cleaning its premises, someone found Yuko’s phone in the parking lot. It was a pink flip phone. Takamatsu found a text he didn’t receive, written at 3:25. “So much tsunami,” it read. From that text he knew she was alive until 3:25. He guessed the tsunami was up to her feet. When Narita heard about what happened to the bank employees, all of them swept off the roof by the tsunami, he returned home, crying. He had last seen Emi the day before, on March 10. It was his wife’s birthday, and Emi delivered a cake. Hiromi Narita was at work at the Ishinomaki Royal Hospital when the earthquake began, and she wasn’t aware there was a tsunami until the following day. Their house was washed away, so the Naritas stayed at the home of a relative. On Sunday morning, Emi’s husband traveled to Onagawa by bicycle, and the next day the Naritas traveled by car. They all looked for Emi’s body. Inside the bank they called out her name. In a corner was a single windsock, shaped like a golden carp. They found her business cards in the mud. In April, six weeks after the tsunami, a body was found floating under debris in the waters off Tsukahama Beach, on the opposite side of the port, in Goburra Bay. It belonged to Michiko Tanno, a    who worked at the bank for more than two decades. Seven or eight bodies floated nearby. Tanno’s sisters, Keiko and Reiko, told Takamatsu the news. They said the body was in good condition. “It was intact,” they said. The body of a second bank employee washed up in Onagawa, at Takenoura Beach, on Sept. 26, 2011. It was a    named Kenta Tamura. The body had been in the ocean for about seven months. Tamura’s parents, Takayuki and Hiromi, were called to identify their son at the morgue. His body was badly decomposed, so the workers laid out his clothes. “We were so discouraged and afraid to see him,” Hiromi said, “so we didn’t encourage ourselves to ask, ‘Can I see my son’s body? ’’u2009” She asked the police to run a DNA test so she could be sure it was really her son. Days later, they burned the body. She picked bones from the ashes. “Looking back,” she said, “even though we were afraid, we should have seen the body there at the morgue. ” “I understand that other families still have missing members,” Takayuki told me, “and I should tell myself I’m glad to find my son, but even though we found the body, it still feels like hell. We had hope until they found the body. ” Takamatsu worried that his wife would be next. If he did find her, he did not know what to expect. He told me about a mannequin head he found on the hillside at Takenoura Beach. For a moment, he thought it was Yuko. It was the closest he had come to finding a body. Tetsuya Takagi, a forensic pathologist at Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University in Sendai, told me about the fates of bodies lost in the sea. The day of the tsunami, he was teaching in Tokyo. At the request of the Tokyo police, he traveled to Sendai and visited gymnasiums filled with bodies. Over eight days, he examined nearly 200 corpses. “If a body is taken into the ocean and disappears,” Takagi told me, “it’s hard to say what happens to it. No one ever really knows how the sea moves or flows. If a body is pulled down to a certain depth, it stays there. If it catches in fishing equipment, it might float across the Pacific and turn up in Hawaii. A body in the sea will mostly become soft as cheese, so that if you touch it, the skin falls apart. In other cases the body may become encased in a substance called grave wax that makes it turn hard like plaster. ” For grave wax to form, which can happen when the body’s fat decomposes, the body usually needs to be in a cold, wet,   environment, he explained. If a body floats, it’s not grave wax. “Decomposition may take anywhere from a few days to several years,” Takagi said. “In Onagawa, after the tsunami, it would have taken about half a year to become ‘cheese’ and a year or two for the flesh to decompose completely, so that all that’s left are bones. ” But it depends on the season, he said, and other variables, including sea animals who might eat the body. He described a body with flesh on its back but with no flesh on its stomach. “I think animals ate it,” he said. A month after the tsunami, the air and water were cold, so the bodies had only just begun to decompose. A muddy cornea here, he said, a green belly there. There were some bodies floating on the surface of the ocean, but most of the bodies were on shore. If a body was found with foam bubbling from its mouth or nose, it meant the person was still breathing underwater before dying. When we think of a tsunami, Takagi told me, we think about drowning, but people also died as a result of hypothermia or blunt trauma (they washed up missing an arm or a leg). There were burn victims, too. In Ishinomaki, a school bus floating on the surface of the wave caught fire, and a search team recovered four charred children. “Only kids,” Takagi said, “with milk teeth. ” A few years ago, a tsunami victim washed up on the shore of Ibaraki as a skeleton with clothes on and bits of tissue on its chest. Clothes float and take longer to decompose than flesh, and so sometimes bones return in the shape of a body, held together by coats, pants, gloves and sneakers. The people who lived in the mountains, where the houses were stacked atop one another, between cliffs and trees, wouldn’t have seen the tsunami coming. But those who lived in the rice fields did. In these flat areas, the tsunami traveled about four miles inland at a speed that gave hundreds of residents time to react but not escape. The supervisors at an elderly care home near the rice fields decided to put all the residents in one room. The elderly were discovered, all dead, with their medical tubes and equipment still attached. “I worked on these, too,” Takagi said. “I saw 300, 400 bodies lined up in a school gymnasium. I’m traumatized, and I will never forget. ” On a Friday morning, Takamatsu and I toured the routes he made years ago when he searched for Yuko on land. We drove on twisting seaside roads. He noted the shaggy cedar trees, the graveyard he crossed to get to the beach with the squeaking sand. There were forests of black pine and overlooks of amaranth and silver grass. After the tsunami, in the thaw of spring, he followed snowmelt on its way to the sea. At Tsukahama Beach, he showed me the dark waters along the concrete port where Michiko Tanno was found. Takamatsu was skittish and walked in a circuitous pattern. We found a pile of purple starfish stashed like cookies behind a mound of old fishnet. He dipped his fingers into a pile of rope and watched crabs scatter. I followed him up a ladder to the top of a concrete wall, about five feet high, that separated a length of dock from the ocean. He put his hands on his hips and squinted at the water. There was nothing. We went to another spot where the seafloor was sparkled with bathroom tiles popular 40 years ago, light blue and dark blue. Plates, bowls and a microwave. On one of his dives, he saw a clock stopped forever at the hour of the tsunami. Along the water, on the way back to the car, about halfway to the parking lot, Takamatsu stopped and closed his eyes. “Listen,” he said. Something like a heartbeat came from the ocean. Takamatsu took a few steps toward some construction workers near a docked boat. The sound emanated from a long burgundy tube that descended into the water. Takamatsu said the tube must be connected to the fishbowl helmet of a diver. “So what is it?” I said. “It’s the sound of breathing,” he said. Three days of training with Takahashi, the dive instructor, earned Takamatsu a beginner’s license. His sessions took place in the ocean, in the shallows. He learned how to put on his mask and how to take it off, how to adjust his buoyancy, how to do rope work, how to navigate in the shadows. He managed only a single dive a month for six months before his breathing calmed and his muscles loosened and he could finally follow Takahashi into the deep. Takamatsu went out with Takahashi’s regular dive customers  —   the ones who dove for fun. They had no idea Takamatsu was searching for a body. Each dive began with an equipment check and recheck. Takamatsu, watched by Takahashi, examined his regulator attachment,   connector, communication unit, pressure gauge, depth gauge. He always carried a flashlight. Takamatsu hoped to reach a depth of 100 feet. It took him a year to dive about 80 feet, and his deepest dive was about 85 feet. At that depth, he could stay 10 minutes. He was never alone in the sea, always with Takahashi or another diver, and every month they swam slow and quiet as manatees over the seafloor. Their flashlights illuminated dog bones and bird bones like constellations in the sand. “What did you see?” I asked. “All the things in a person’s life,” Takamatsu said. In December 2013, Takamatsu spent an hour each day reading a   textbook to earn the national diving certification that would allow him to move debris and search for bodies. He passed the exam in February 2014. For months, he dove with Takahashi’s volunteer groups to remove debris off the northern coastline. He retrieved small items like fishing ropes, and once he found a tire and made a knot on a rope so volunteers on the surface could pull it onto a boat. After six months, Takahashi started to give Takamatsu lessons he wouldn’t normally give: how to find and retrieve bodies from the ocean, living or dead. Takamatsu learned the way colors shifted at different depths, because it would help him locate a body that had sunk. On sunny days, he descended through shades of blue, and in storms, shades of brown. He learned that the bodies of drowned people are usually found poised with buttocks high, hands and feet dangling. The corpses of scuba divers are like dead bugs, on their backs, hands and feet floating. By this January, Takamatsu had been on 110 dives, each lasting 40 to 50 minutes. He was not just looking for the body he was also searching for a wallet, clothes or jewelry  —   anything that might identify his wife after five years in the ocean. “I expected it to be difficult,” Takamatsu said, “and I’ve found it quite difficult, but it is the only thing I can do. I have no choice but to keep looking for her. I feel closest to her in the ocean. ” I thought of the song that a French composer named Sylvain Guinet composed for Takamatsu after he learned of his loss. The title is “Yuko Takamatsu. ” Takamatsu listened to the song, a piano solo, when he shopped online, ironed his clothes, drove his car and as he fell asleep. I asked him if the song brought back memories of Yuko. “It does not bring back memories,” he said. “Because it is not something that I forget. ” We often think of searching as a kind of movement, a forward motion through time, but maybe it can also be the opposite, a suspension of time and memory. Heidegger wrote of a metaphoric pain, calling it the “joining of the rift. ” It’s this rift, he said, that holds together things that have been torn apart, to perhaps create a new space where joy and sadness can find communion. This is the space I believed Takamatsu found beneath the sea, where he could feel close to his wife, in the rift between “missing” and “deceased. ” There was one survivor from the bank. The day of the tsunami, fishermen found him, tangled in debris, drifting in and out of consciousness. A month later, the families organized a meeting with the bank, and everyone hoped to speak with him. They wanted to know why the employees evacuated to the roof and not the hospital. They wanted to learn any details they could about their loved ones. But the meeting ended before they could speak with the survivor. “Everyone was quite confused,” Takamatsu said. “We thought we would see him again. ” The bank would schedule a meeting, but the survivor always canceled. The following year, Takamatsu received a letter from the bank. It was a formal invitation to a memorial service. “We had nothing to talk to them about anymore,” Takamatsu said. At that point, he and the other families discussed filing a lawsuit. 77 Bank was the largest employer in the region, and no one wanted to sue, but they needed to know what happened. Keiko and Reiko Tanno, the sisters of Michiko, joined some of the families in the suit, with their elderly mother as the legal plaintiff. “Everyone assumed they died when they were trying to evacuate on the staircase,” Keiko said. “They didn’t mention that they were on the roof waiting to die. ” The trial began in February 2014 in Sendai, and the district court ruled in favor of the bank, concluding that its evacuation plan was reasonable. In April 2015, the families’ lawsuit failed on appeal. By then, though, they had finally been able to hear the survivor tell his story in court. In January, I met Keiko and Reiko at the bank memorial outside the hospital. We sat outside in the snow around a foldout table stacked with court transcriptions. Keiko told me the survivor’s story as she remembered hearing him tell it in court. At 2:46, there was an earthquake, she said. The manager of the bank in Onagawa was out of the building when it happened. (His name and the survivor’s have been kept secret by the bank.) He returned at 2:55. The employees were fixing things. He told them about the tsunami warning. Two customers fled. He told everyone to lock up and put documents into a safety box. The survivor and Kenta locked the front door and unlocked the door to the roof. It wasn’t easy to open. The manager called the bank headquarters in Sendai to notify them about where they were going. He didn’t consult with anyone about where to evacuate, and no one doubted his commands about going to the roof. One employee asked to leave. “I want to go home,” she said. “I’m worried about my children. ” The tide was being sucked out to sea. She knew it was not safe to leave, but she wanted to try to get to her children. When she stepped outside, it was 3:05, and the tsunami sirens were already wailing. She lived. At 3:10, the remaining employees climbed to the roof. They brought a radio. The tsunami was expected to reach a height of 10 feet, and the roof was 30 feet. It would arrive at 3:30. They had time. A few men went back downstairs to get coats. It was cold and snowing. By 3:15, all 13 employees were on the roof. Everyone seemed calm. They made phone calls and wrote to their families. Yuko wrote to Takamatsu. Michiko wrote to her sisters: “I’m safe. ” The bank manager told the survivor and Kenta to listen to the radio and monitor the sea. There was a building between the bank and the water, so the men walked to the edge of the roof and watched the bay. Kenta noticed that the hospital on the mountain was crowded with evacuees. People were standing on top of cars in the parking lot, watching for the wave. He talked to the survivor about the hospital and wondered if they should go there. They agreed that they still had time to run. Everyone seemed calm. They decided to stay. The survivor saw the ships near the fish market move suddenly over the water. The bank was built on a floodplain over the ocean, and water swelled up from below. It cracked the earth and spread through the streets. Shortly after 3:30, the wave came. It was low at first and rushed past the building, but then the water level rose, gradually at first and then quickly, to about 65 feet from 19 feet. It took five minutes for the ocean to flood the first floor. The manager commanded everyone to the highest point, a small electrical room with a   vertical ladder. He was the last to climb, and when he stepped up, the building was already underwater. Masaaki Narita wore Mickey Mouse slippers, jeans and a sweater vest patterned with reindeer. We were in his new home in Ishinomaki. He rubbed his back and sighed. He said diving caused him back pain. At the shore dive earlier that day, he wore eight kilograms of weight so that he wouldn’t float. “I’m grateful my husband is diving,” Hiromi, his wife, said, “because I can see how deeply he loved my daughter. He’s still in training, so he doesn’t talk much about what he sees, but when he comes home, he looks good even though he’s tired. I think it’s a good process for him because he can feel closer to his daughter. Even if we can find some of her things, I’m sure it’s going to lead us to a clue of where we should look next. ” In the living room were two shrines to their daughter. Hiromi sat on the floor by the coffee table and faced a   portrait of Emi. “So we can still have her live in the middle of us,” she said. The portrait was based on a photograph of her and her future husband at Disneyland seven years ago. Emi’s husband lived with them for a year after the tsunami, but they knew they couldn’t keep him forever they told him he should move on with his life and find another wife. “I can’t think that this was her doom,” Hiromi said. “If it was inevitable, then at least we would have sent her off on a warm bed. She wasn’t born to stay in the cold water. I have the feeling she might be saying, ‘Why did you let me be born?’ Of course, my daughter would have never thought her life would have ended the next day. We take it for granted that tomorrow comes. I just wonder what she was thinking as she fell asleep the night before. ” Hiromi covered her face with her hands. “She was my only child,” she said. “She was with me all the time ever since she was born. The last five years I still cannot believe she is not with me anymore. ” She would have been 31 this year. “You have to live longer than your parents,” she told me. “I tell that to everyone who is as young as my daughter. ” Hiromi’s mother, Emi’s grandmother, joined us in the living room. She cooked the food that Hiromi took to the sea. She wore a green apron patterned with flowers and had a thick head of curly gray hair. She sat on the chair beside us. “Actually,” Hiromi said, gesturing to the grandmother, “she asked if I wanted to join her in suicide a few times after my daughter was gone. ” The grandmother looked at me and nodded. “I don’t really want to live anymore, but I just couldn’t do it, because if we are gone, my husband will be alone. ” “Does he know?” I asked. “We told him later,” she said. Emi had been living in a   apartment two minutes away from her parents. All the floors were muddy after the tsunami, but the Naritas recovered most of her things. They found a photo album filled with photographs of Emi that Emi had wanted to show at her wedding reception, which had been delayed instead, Hiromi used them at Emi’s funeral. They never found Emi’s cellphone. Hiromi didn’t want to close her daughter’s account, so she wrote a letter to the carrier and asked to keep it open because it was the only way she could communicate with her daughter. The phone company came to the house with a new phone  —   same number and address  —   as an offering to the family. Hiromi added the cellphone to the shrine. Emi’s friends text her on her birthday. Hiromi texts her every day. I’m sorry, she writes. I’m sorry. Masaaki disappeared into his bedroom. Hiromi and the grandmother wept. “We need cake,” Hiromi said. The grandmother hurried to the kitchen and returned with cake. Chocolate, strawberry, chestnut. Masaaki was alone in the darkness of his bedroom. The women ate cake and Hiromi told me a story about her daughter’s hair. Because Emi was missing, they didn’t have anything to put in the grave. She wanted something. So she pulled some of Emi’s hair out of the drain and buried it. On Jan. 11, in the afternoon, Takamatsu, wearing a silver tracksuit and   white sneakers, came to watch a body hunt conducted by the coast guard. The tracksuit glimmered like tinfoil. Narita wore a puffy jacket with a fur hood and small dark sunglasses. Keiko and Reiko, the sisters, arrived with food  —   steaming rice balls stuffed with oysters and sour plums. The search was Narita’s idea. Every now and then, he asked the Japan Coast Guard to conduct an official search for his daughter’s body. He had asked them to search in May, and in October, and again in January. The government let Narita decide where. On this day, Narita chose a shipping route that belonged to the government, because it was a place he would never be able to dive himself. Not many people came to watch the search  —   only the families of the bank victims and Takahashi  —   and a few local residents. Members of the Japanese press outnumbered spectators. The   divers arrived by sea. There were seven, dressed in bright    dive suits and thick yellow helmets. The men would dive for an hour, tracing a length of rope dropped in the water. On the way, they would record what they saw for Narita and Takamatsu. They docked and hopped ashore. They were militaristic and ceremonial. Everyone was quiet. They stood in a line, saluted their commander. After a brief speech, they saluted the families and drove the boat 20 meters from the dock. Hiromi poured coffee in the ocean for Emi, and everyone took a photograph. She walked over to me and pointed out to sea. “Today I served Salisbury steak,” she said. “Emi’s favorite. ” We waited an hour before the divers resurfaced. One by one, they climbed belly first onto the boat ramp and came back to shore. The dive commander briefed the families. “We found nothing,” he said. Narita nodded and wiped his nose. Takamatsu was very still. “Nothing that didn’t already belong in the sea,” the dive commander continued. “The soda cans are all new. But do you want to see the photos anyway?” “Yes,” Narita said. The underwater images played on a laptop computer in the back of a van. Narita and Takamatsu leaned forward to look inside. The commander talked about the way the water felt. Here is a section of a building, he said, and part of a clock. Here is a Coke can. Takamatsu walked quickly away from the crowd. He stayed close to the sea, and I tried to catch up with him. He started searching again. He stepped onto a pile of rocks, put his hands on his knees and stared down into the sea. The search for love, the search  —   his, hers, everyone’s  —   is not for a needle in a haystack, nor a fish in the sea. It’s for a specific person on earth.

Some of his neighbours had another name for him:   ”The vampire,” because they frequently saw him go out at night. ’ ’   Masood, 52, was born in Kent, grew up in Rye, East Sussex, and   had previously been investigated by MI5 over concerns relating to   violent extremism. ’ ”   While authorities said they were not aware he was planning   Wednesday’s attack, the  that he had a   string of previous convictions over a   period from 1982 to   2003.

ISIS did not name   Masood in its statement released to Amaq, the news agency linked   to the group. ’ ’   Masood was not named for more than 24 hours as the police   investigated the attack. In the early hours of Thursday morning,   the police raided  in connection to the   investigation and made eight arrests. ’ ’  ’ ’   PC Keith Palmer, a British police officer; Aysha Frade, a     college worker; and Kurt Cochran, an American   tourist,  while seven of the   injured remained in hospital in a critical condition on Thursday. ’ ’ Met Police said Masood was   born in Kent on Christmas Day, 1964.

The Westminster attacker, an alleged ”teacher,”   was never actually a qualified teacher,  and apparently called himself an   ”English tutor.” ’ ’   A source, who met him in a professional capacity, told Sky News   Masood was ”a big bloke, he looked like he was a bodybuilder,   wouldn’’t want to mess with him.” ’ ’   A neighbour described him as a ”quiet man.”  that she often saw him washing   his car and mowing his lawn when he lived in Quayside. ’ ’   Another  that he took care of his garden: ’ ’   The Independent : ’ ’ because he would ”frequently” go out at night   dressed in black. ’ ’ he stayed at a £   hotel in   Brighton on Tuesday night, telling staff before he left on the   day of the attack that London ”isn’’t what it used to be.” Masood   checked in at the Preston Park guest house on Friday night and   then again on Tuesday night: ’ ’   The Hyundai 4X4 car he used to mow down pedestrians on   Westminster Bridge was rented from Enterprise in Birmingham,    ’ ’   At about 2:40 p. m.

It is common for the bodies of dead migrants to be found after starvation and exposure to heat on U. S. soil.  After illegal immigrants get past the river or fence, they still have to clear a secondary checkpoint by U. S. Border Patrol. Those checkpoints are routinely set up between 60 and 80 miles north of the border. In places like Falfurrias, Texas, human smugglers force illegal immigrants to walk dozens of miles through harsh   terrain in order to get around the checkpoints. That harsh trek in addition to the extreme weather in Texas and Arizona often leads to fatal consequences where human smugglers often leave behind those who are not able to keep up with the pace. Unfortunately, the remoteness of those areas often leaves families searching for answers since many of the heavily decomposed bodies found in those areas remain unidentified. 2. The entire border is broken down into regions or “turf” controlled by Mexican  . Mexican cartels fight for the lucrative corridors into the U. S. and the turf they win extends deep into both countries. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s maps give a general overview of which regions specific groups control and the U. S. can be seen broken up into Mexican cartel turf. From the Tijuana Cartel south of San Diego all the way to the Gulf Cartel south of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico, each region is controlled by organized crime group factions operating under the banner of a Mexican “cartel. ” 3. One U. S. border sector, Tucson, has Mexican cartel scouts operating deep within U. S. territory. The remote regions in the Tucson Sector of Arizona have Sinaloa Cartel scouts who enter the U. S. and use radios to report on law enforcement presence for the purposes of guiding illegal loads of humans and narcotics into the interior of the U. S. These scouts are sometimes U. S. These scouts often hide near the tops of mountains and can call cartel strike teams to go after anyone who uses the territory without permission from the cartel  —   even though it’s U. S. soil. 4. U. S. law enforcement along the border are often afraid to be targeted by Mexican cartels. Despite living in the U. S. federal agents do not want to be singled out by the Mexican drug cartels that they are fighting. Once they are singled out, cartel members are able to exact their revenge through various means. In 2016, a woman was arrested for falsely claiming that a particular U. S. DEA agent was receiving cartel bribes the later woman recanted her story. In a similar fashion, in 2014, Mexico’s Gulf Cartel burned down the house of an investigator with the Starr County   Drug Trafficking Area Task Force, The Monitor reported at the time. According to statements made by the Starr County District Attorney, the arson was retribution for a series of drug busts made by the task force. 5. U. S. gangs act as enforcement and smugglers for Mexican cartels this occurs along the border and as far north as Minnesota. This fact is best proven by a news that broke in 2014 when a Sinaloa Cartel methamphetamine stash house was robbed in St. Paul Minnesota. The Mexican cartel hired gang members from California to fly to St. Paul and investigate the robbery. Two teenagers ended up kidnapped and tortured  —  one had his finger nearly severed from his hand  —   in the U. S. gang members effort to force the teens to reveal any information on the robbery. 6. Public corruption of both U. S. politicians and law enforcement officers is common along the border. While corruption is present in every American city, federal authorities have noted a disproportionate increase of public corruption cases in U. S. border cities. Police officers, county sheriff’s, federal agents and other officials within the law enforcement community have fallen prey to the lure of cartel cash. One of the most famous cases in South Texas dealt with the Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Treviño who was receiving funds from a Mexican cartel leader in exchange for favors. In addition to Treviño, his department’s street level narcotics unit and crime stoppers program were engaged in stealing drug loads and selling them on the side. The practice of using cops to steal drug loads continues to be in use by various cells operating along the border. 7. Mexican cartels are paid and fueled by illegal immigration no one crosses the border without paying the cartels. As Mexican cartels continue to exert control over their territories, their ruthless methods have since transferred to another of their money making enterprises human smuggling. The presence of the criminal element has turned the “quest for the American Dream” into a nightmare. Illegal immigrants are constantly extorted, the women are often raped, and anyone who dares to cross without paying the cartel fee faces serious consequences. Mexican drug cartels also routinely used human smuggling groups as diversions in order to move large drug loads over the river some of the illegal immigrants who are not able to cover their smuggling fees are forced to move drugs. 8. Some factions of the Gulf and Los Zetas cartels routinely make as much or more from illegal immigration than from narcotics. According to a report by the Texas Department of Public Safety, during the summer surge of 2014, Mexico’s Gulf Cartel made $38 million from human smuggling alone. According to that report, “nearly all illegal aliens who have illegally entered the United States made use of alien smuggling organizations (ASOs) nearly all of which are associated with Mexican cartels. ” 9. Illegal Immigrants are often kidnapped by the cartels they are paying for permission to cross the border into the U. S. In addition to the smuggling fees, which run from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars depending on the immigrant’s country of origin, cartel members also make additional funds by kidnapping and holding illegal immigrants for ransom. Relatives are forced to wire funds to the cartel in Mexico to keep their relatives from being mutilated. Brandon Darby is managing director and    of Breitbart Texas.

He barely had time to settle in before members of the Islamic State’s secret service, wearing masks over their faces, came to inform him and his German friend that they no longer wanted Europeans to come to Syria. Where they were really needed was back home, to help carry out the group’s plan of waging terrorism across the globe. “He was speaking openly about the situation, saying that they have loads of people living in European countries and waiting for commands to attack the European people,” Mr. Sarfo recounted on Monday, in an interview with The New York Times conducted in English inside the   prison near Bremen. “And that was before the Brussels attacks, before the Paris attacks. ” The masked man explained that, although the group was well set up in some European countries, it needed more attackers in Germany and Britain, in particular. “They said, ‘Would you mind to go back to Germany, because that’s what we need at the moment,’” Mr. Sarfo recalled. “And they always said they wanted to have something that is occurring in the same time: They want to have loads of attacks at the same time in England and Germany and France. ” The operatives belonged to an intelligence unit of the Islamic State known in Arabic as the Emni, which has become a combination of an internal police force and an external operations branch, dedicated to exporting terror abroad, according to thousands of pages of French, Belgian, German and Austrian intelligence and interrogation documents obtained by The Times. The Islamic State’s attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 brought global attention to the group’s external terrorism network, which began sending fighters abroad two years ago. Now, Mr. Sarfo’s account, along with those of other captured recruits, has further pulled back the curtain on the group’s machinery for projecting violence beyond its borders. What they describe is a multilevel secret service under the overall command of the Islamic State’s most senior Syrian operative, spokesman and propaganda chief, Abu Muhammad  . Below him is a tier of lieutenants empowered to plan attacks in different regions of the world, including a “secret service for European affairs,” a “secret service for Asian affairs” and a “secret service for Arab affairs,” according to Mr. Sarfo. Reinforcing the idea that the Emni is a core part of the Islamic State’s operations, the interviews and documents indicate that the unit has carte blanche to recruit and reroute operatives from all parts of the organization  —   from new arrivals to seasoned battlefield fighters, and from the group’s special forces and its elite commando units. Taken together, the interrogation records show that operatives are selected by nationality and grouped by language into small, discrete units whose members sometimes only meet one another on the eve of their departure abroad. And through the coordinating role played by Mr. Adnani, terror planning has gone    with the group’s extensive propaganda operations  —   including, Mr. Sarfo claimed, monthly meetings in which Mr. Adnani chose which grisly videos to promote based on battlefield events. Based on the accounts of operatives arrested so far, the Emni has become the crucial cog in the group’s terrorism machinery, and its trainees led the Paris attacks and built the suitcase bombs used in a Brussels airport terminal and subway station. Investigation records show that its foot soldiers have also been sent to Austria, Germany, Spain, Lebanon, Tunisia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia. With European officials stretched by a string of assaults by seemingly unconnected attackers who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, Mr. Sarfo suggested that there may be more of a link than the authorities yet know. He said he was told that undercover operatives in Europe used new converts as   or “clean men,” who help link up people interested in carrying out attacks with operatives who can pass on instructions on everything from how to make a suicide vest to how to credit their violence to the Islamic State. The group has sent “hundreds of operatives” back to the European Union, with “hundreds more in Turkey alone,” according to a senior United States intelligence official and a senior American defense official, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence. Mr. Sarfo, who was recently moved out of solitary confinement at his German prison because he is no longer considered violent, agrees with that assessment. “Many of them have returned,” he said. “Hundreds, definitely. ” The first port of call for new arrivals to the Islamic State is a network of dormitories in Syria, just across the border from Turkey. There, recruits are interviewed and inventoried. Mr. Sarfo was fingerprinted, and a doctor came to draw a blood sample and perform a physical examination. A man with a laptop conducted an intake interview. “He was asking normal questions like: ‘What’s your name? What’s your second name? Who’s your mom? Where’s your mom originally from? What did you study? What degree do you have? What’s your ambition? What do you want to become? ’” Mr. Sarfo said. His background was also of interest. He was a regular at a radical mosque in Bremen that had already sent about 20 members to Syria, at least four of whom were killed in battle, according to Daniel Heinke, the German Interior Ministry’s counterterrorism coordinator for the area. And he had served a   prison sentence for breaking into a supermarket safe and stealing 23, 000 euros. Even though the punishment for theft in areas under Islamic State control is amputation, a criminal past can be a valued asset, Mr. Sarfo said, “especially if they know you have ties to organized crime and they know you can get fake IDs, or they know you have contact men in Europe who can smuggle you into the European Union. ” The bureaucratic nature of the intake procedure was recently confirmed by American officials after USB drives were recovered in the recently liberated Syrian city of Manbij, one of the hubs for processing foreign fighters. Mr. Sarfo checked all the necessary boxes, and on the third day after his arrival, the members of the Emni came to ask for him. He wanted to fight in Syria and Iraq, but the masked operatives explained that they had a vexing problem. “They told me that there aren’t many people in Germany who are willing to do the job,” Mr. Sarfo said soon after his arrest last year, according to the transcript of his interrogation by German officials, which runs more than 500 pages. “They said they had some in the beginning. But one after another, you could say, they chickened out, because they got scared  —   cold feet. Same in England. ” By contrast, the group had more than enough volunteers for France. “My friend asked them about France,” Mr. Sarfo said. “And they started laughing. But really serious laughing, with tears in their eyes. They said, ‘Don’t worry about France.’ ‘Mafi mushkilah’  —   in Arabic, it means ‘no problem. ’” That conversation took place in April 2015, seven months before the coordinated killings in Paris in November, the worst terrorist attack in Europe in over a decade. While some details of Mr. Sarfo’s account cannot be verified, his statements track with what other recruits related in their interrogations. And both prison officials and the German intelligence agents who debriefed Mr. Sarfo after his arrest said they found him credible. Since the rise of the Islamic State over two years ago, intelligence agencies have been collecting nuggets on the Emni. Originally, the unit was tasked with policing the Islamic State’s members, including conducting interrogations and ferreting out spies, according to interrogation records and analysts. But French members arrested in 2014 and 2015 explained that the Emni had taken on a new portfolio: projecting terror abroad. “It’s the Emni that ensures the internal security inside Dawla”  —   the Arabic word for state  —   “and oversees external security by sending abroad people they recruited, or else sending individuals to carry out violent acts, like what happened in Tunisia inside the museum in Tunis, or else the aborted plot in Belgium,” said Nicolas Moreau, 32, a French citizen who was arrested last year after leaving the Islamic State in Syria, according to his statement to France’s domestic intelligence agency. Mr. Moreau explained that he had run a restaurant in Raqqa, Syria, the de facto capital of the group’s territory, where he had served meals to key members of the Emni  —   including Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the    commander of the Paris attacks, who was killed in a standoff with the police days later. Other interrogations, as well as Mr. Sarfo’s account, have led investigators to conclude that the Emni also trained and dispatched the gunman who opened fire on a beach in Sousse, Tunisia, in June, and the man who prepared the Brussels airport bombs. Records from French, Austrian and Belgian intelligence agencies show that at least 28 operatives recruited by the Emni succeeded in deploying to countries outside of the Islamic State’s core territory, mounting both successful attacks and plots that were foiled. Officials say that dozens of other operatives have slipped through and formed sleeper cells. In his own interactions with the Emni, Mr. Sarfo realized that they were preparing a global portfolio of terrorists and looking to fill holes in their international network, he said. He described what he had been told about the group’s work to build an infrastructure in Bangladesh. There, a siege by a team of Islamic State gunmen left at least 20 hostages dead at a cafe last month, almost all of them foreigners. Mr. Sarfo said that for Asian recruits, the group was looking specifically for militants who had emerged from Al Qaeda’s network in the region. “People especially from Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia  —   they have people who used to work for Al Qaeda, and once they joined the Islamic State, they are asking them questions about their experiences and if they have contacts,” he said. In his briefings with the German authorities, and again in the interview this week, Mr. Sarfo raised the possibility that some of the recent attackers in Europe who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State’s leader during their assaults might have a more direct link to the group than officials believe. Mr. Sarfo explained that the Emni keeps many of its operatives underground in Europe. They act as nodes that can remotely activate potential suicide attackers who have been drawn in by propaganda. Linking them are what Mr. Sarfo called “clean men,” new converts to Islam with no established ties to radical groups. “These people are not in direct contact with these guys who are doing the attacks, because they know if these people start talking, they will get caught,” he said of the underground operatives. “They mostly use people who are new Muslims, who are converts,” he said. Those “clean” converts “get in contact with the people, and they give them the message. ” And in the case of some videotaped pledges of allegiance, the   can then send the video on to the handler in Europe, who uploads it for use by the Islamic State’s propaganda channels. The intelligence documents and Mr. Sarfo agree that the Islamic State has made the most of its recruits’ nationalities by sending them back to plot attacks at home. Yet one important region where the Emni is not thought to have succeeded in sending trained attackers is North America, Mr. Sarfo said, recalling what the members of the branch told him. Though dozens of Americans have become members of the Islamic State, and some have been recruited into the external operations wing, “they know it’s hard for them to get Americans into America” once they have traveled to Syria, he said. “For America and Canada, it’s much easier for them to get them over the social network, because they say the Americans are dumb  —   they have open gun policies,” he said. “They say we can radicalize them easily, and if they have no prior record, they can buy guns, so we don’t need to have no contact man who has to provide guns for them. ” Since late 2014, the Islamic State has instructed foreigners joining the group to make their trip look like a holiday in southern Turkey, including booking a return flight and paying for an   vacation at a beach resort, from which smugglers arrange their transport into Syria, according to intelligence documents and Mr. Sarfo’s account. That cover story creates pressure to keep things moving quickly during the recruits’ training in Syria, and most get a bare minimum  —   just a few days of basic weapons practice, in some instances. “When they go back to France or in Germany, they can say, ‘I was only on holidays in Turkey,’” Mr. Sarfo said. “The longer they stay in the Islamic State, the more suspicious the secret service in the West gets, and that’s why they try to do the training as quickly as possible. ” Mr. Sarfo’s facility in both German and English  —   he studied construction at Newham College in East London  —   made him attractive as a potential attacker. Though the Emni approached him several times to ask him to return to Germany, he demurred, he said. Eventually, Mr. Sarfo, perhaps because of his burly build  —      and around 286 pounds when he arrived in Syria, though he has lost weight since then  —   was drafted into the Islamic State’s quwat khas, Arabic for special forces. The unit only admitted single men who agreed not to marry during the duration of their training. In addition to providing the offensive force to infiltrate cities during battles, it was one of several elite units that became recruiting pools for the external operations branch, Mr. Sarfo said. Along with his German friend, he was driven to the desert outside Raqqa. “They dropped us off in the middle of nowhere and told us, ‘We are here,’” he said, according to the transcript of one of his interrogation sessions. “So we’re standing in the desert and thought to ourselves, ‘What’s going on? ’” When the two Germans looked more closely, they realized there were cavelike dwellings around them. Everything above ground was painted with mud so as to be invisible to drones. “Showering was prohibited. Eating was prohibited, too, unless they gave it to you,” Mr. Sarfo said, adding that he had shared a cave with five or six others. Even drinking water was harshly rationed. “Each dwelling received two cups of water a day, put on the doorstep,” he said. “And the purpose of this was to test us, see who really wants it, who’s firm. ” The grueling training began: hours of running, jumping,   parallel bars, crawling. The recruits began fainting. By the second week, they were each given a Kalashnikov assault rifle and told to sleep with it between their legs until it became “like a third arm,” he said, according to his interrogation transcript. The punishment for failing to keep up was harsh. “There was one boy who refused to get up, because he was just too exhausted,” Mr. Sarfo told the authorities. “So they tied him to a pole with his legs and his arms and left him there. ” He learned that the special forces program involved 10 levels of training. After he graduated to Level 2, he was moved to an island on a river in Tabqa, Syria. The recruits’ sleeping spots now consisted of holes in the ground, covered by sticks and twigs. They practiced swimming, scuba diving and navigating by the stars. Throughout his training, Mr. Sarfo rubbed shoulders with an international cadre of recruits. When he first arrived at the desert campus, he ran laps alongside Moroccans, Egyptians, at least one Indonesian, a Canadian and a Belgian. And out on the island, he learned of similar special units, including one called Jaysh   or the Army of the Caliphate. A   criminal complaint indicates that the Islamic State tried to recruit at least one American into that unit, but he declined to enroll. The man, Mohamad Jamal Khweis, a    from Alexandria, Va. traveled to Syria in December, only to be captured by Kurdish troops in Iraq in March. In his debriefing with the F. B. I. he explained that early on, he was approached by members of the unit. “During his stay at this safe house, representatives from Jaysh Khalifa, a group described by the defendant as an ‘offensive group,’ visited the new ISIL recruits,” the complaint says. “The representatives explained that their group was responsible for accepting volunteers from foreign countries who would be trained and sent back to their countries to conduct operations and execute attacks on behalf of ISIL. The group’s requirements, among other things, were that recruits had to be single, would train in remote locations, must be free of any injuries and had to stay reclusive when returning to their home countries. ” As he progressed through the special forces training, Mr. Sarfo became closer with the emir of the camp, a Moroccan, who began to divulge details about how the Islamic State’s external operations effort was structured, he said. Mr. Sarfo learned that there was one outsize figure behind the group’s strategies and ambitions. “The big man behind everything is Abu Muhammad ” he said. “He is the head of the Emni, and he is the head of the special forces as well,” Mr. Sarfo added. “Everything goes back to him. ” Born in the town of Binnish in northern Syria, Mr. Adnani is said to be 39, and is the subject of a $5 million bounty from the State Department’s Rewards for Justice program. But details about his life remain a mystery. There are very few available photos of him, and the one used on the State Department’s website is years old. Mr. Sarfo explained that when recruits to the special forces finished all 10 levels of training, they were blindfolded and driven to meet Mr. Adnani, where they pledged allegiance to him directly. Mr. Sarfo was told that the blindfolds stayed on the whole time, so that even Mr. Adnani’s   fighters never know what he looks like. To the world, Mr. Adnani is better known as the official spokesman of the Islamic State, and the man who put out a global call this year for Muslims to attack unbelievers wherever they were, however they could. “Adnani is much more than just the mouthpiece of this group,” said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington who tracks the group’s leadership. “He is heavily involved in external operations. He is sort of the administrative ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ at the top of the pyramid,” who signs off on attack plans, the details of which are handled by his subordinates. During his time in Syria, Mr. Sarfo was contacted by other German fighters who wanted him to be an actor in a propaganda film aimed at German speakers. They drove to Palmyra, and Mr. Sarfo was told to hold the group’s black flag and to walk again and again in front of the camera as they filmed repeated takes. Syrian captives were forced to kneel, and the other German fighters shot them, showing an interest only in the cinematic effect. One turned to Mr. Sarfo immediately after killing a victim and asked: “How did I look like? Did I look good, the way I executed?” Mr. Sarfo said he had learned that videos like the one he acted in were vetted by Mr. Adnani himself in a monthly meeting of senior operatives. “There’s a vetting procedure,” he said. “Once a month they have a shura  —   which is a sitting, a meeting  —   where all the videos and everything that is important, they start speaking about it. And Abu Muhammad   is the head of the shura. ” Mr. Sarfo said he had started doubting his allegiance to ISIS during his training, after seeing how cruelly they treated those who could not keep up. Making the propaganda video provided his final disillusionment when he saw how many times they recorded each scene in the   film. Back in Germany, when he had been inspired by similar videos, he had always assumed they were real, not staged. He began plotting his escape, which took weeks and involved sprinting and crawling in a field of mud before crossing into Turkey. He was arrested at Bremen Airport, where he landed on July 20, 2015, and he voluntarily confessed. He is now serving a   term on terrorism charges. Among the Islamic State’s innovations is the role of foreigners, especially Europeans, in the planning of attacks. Mr. Sarfo’s account agrees with investigation documents and the assessments of terrorism experts, who say that French and Belgian citizens like Mr. Abaaoud are more than just operatives and have been given managing roles. “It’s a creative and interesting operational road map, to be able to lean on someone like Abaaoud, who has his own network abroad,” said   Brisard, chairman of the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism in Paris. “They gave him the autonomy regarding tactics and strategy, even if the operation as a whole still needs a green light from the Islamic State’s leadership. ” Looking at the current leaders of the Emni, investigators have homed in on two in particular. They go by the aliases Abu Souleymane, a French citizen, and Abu Ahmad, described as Syrian. Both are considered top lieutenants of Mr. Adnani, according to the senior American defense official and senior intelligence official. The two men play a direct role in identifying fighters to be sent overseas, in choosing targets and in organizing logistics for operatives, including paying for smugglers to get them to Europe and, in at least one case, sending Western Union transfers, according to European intelligence documents. A glimpse into the possible role of Abu Souleymane came from one of the hostages held by suicide bombers inside the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in November. After gunning down dozens of concertgoers, two of the suicide bombers retreated into a hallway with a group of hostages, forcing them to sit against the windows as human shields, said the hostage, David   24. In the      standoff that ensued, Mr. Fritz heard one of the bombers ask the other, “Should we call Souleymane?” The second operative appeared annoyed that the first had asked the question in French, and ordered him to switch to Arabic. “I immediately understood that, yes, this was the individual, maybe not the individual who had organized the attack, but who held a place in the hierarchy above them,” Mr. Fritz said in a telephone interview. His testimony is also included in a detailed,   report by France’s antiterrorism police. “They were absolutely, like soldiers,” awaiting orders, he said. Souleymane, whose full nom de guerre is Abu Souleymane   or Abu Souleymane the Frenchman, is believed to be a French national in his 30s who is of either Moroccan or Tunisian ancestry, according to Ludovico Carlino, a senior analyst with IHS Conflict Monitor in London. Mr. Carlino says he believes that Souleymane was promoted to be the top terrorism planner for Europe after Mr. Abaaoud’s death. A snapshot of the other senior leader, Abu Ahmad, appears in the account of a man who investigators have concluded was supposed to be part of the team of Paris attackers: an Algerian named Adel Haddadi. Mr. Haddadi said he and another member of the team, a former    member from Pakistan named Muhammad Usman, were separated from two other attackers after they reached Greece by boat. Mr. Haddadi, 28, and Mr. Usman, 22, were eventually arrested in a migrant camp in Salzburg, Austria. The two men sent alongside them became the first suicide bombers to detonate their vests outside the Stade de France during the November attacks. After arriving in Syria and being routed to the international dormitory there in February 2015, Mr. Haddadi worked as a cook in Raqqa for months before a member of the Emni came to see him, according to French and Austrian investigation documents. “One day, a Syrian came into the kitchen to see me and said that someone called Abu Ahmad wanted to see me,” Mr. Haddadi was quoted as saying in the Austrian record of his interrogation. He was driven to a   building, where another Syrian holding a walkie talkie radioed Abu Ahmad. They waited for hours before the Syrian got orders to drive the recruit to the next location. In the street, a Saudi man wearing all white was waiting, and asked Mr. Haddadi to go on a walk. After 300 yards, they reached an empty apartment building and sat down. “I was scared, I wanted to leave, but he talked the whole time,” Mr. Haddadi told the authorities. “He said only positive things about me, that Daesh trusted me and that I now needed to prove myself worthy of that trust. He said that Daesh was going to send me to France,” Mr. Haddadi added, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “The details, he said, I would get them once I arrived in France. ” Sometime after that, Abu Ahmad arrived. Mr. Haddadi described him as a Syrian man between 38 and 42 years old, slim with a long, black beard, and dressed all in black. He was, Mr. Haddadi said, “the giver of orders. ” Abu Ahmad brought Mr. Haddadi together with three other potential attackers, with the last man, Mr. Usman, being introduced just a day before they all set out for Europe. Mr. Haddadi and two of the other men were native Arabic speakers, and Mr. Usman spoke enough Arabic to communicate with them, the interrogation documents said. The day of their departure, Abu Ahmad came and gave them his Turkish cellphone number, instructing them to store it in their phone as “FF,” to avoid registering a name. He gave Mr. Haddadi $2, 000 in $100 bills, and they were driven to the Turkish border. A man met them in Turkey to take their photographs, and returned with Syrian passports. Another smuggler arranged their Oct. 3 boat trip to Leros, Greece. All of these logistical steps, as well as Western Union money transfers, were organized by Abu Ahmad, one of the senior lieutenants running the Islamic State’s efforts to export terror. Until his arrest in December, Mr. Haddadi remained in touch with Abu Ahmad through messages on Telegram and via text messages to his Turkish number, according to the investigation record. Abu Ahmad’s Turkish number was found somewhere else, too: written on a slip of paper in the pants pocket of the severed leg of one of the suicide bombers at the Stade de France.', [('new', 2.23), ('police', 1.55), ('don', 1.26), ('years', 1.24), ('like', 1.17), ('time', 1.02), ('just', 1.02), ('know', 1.0), ('killed', 0.98), ('officials', 0.94), ('people', 0.9), ('terrorist', 0.88), ('really', 0.85), ('want', 0.84), ('long', 0.83), ('make', 0.82), ('world', 0.82), ('way', 0.81), ('ms', 0.79), ('going', 0.76), ('security', 0.73), ('good', 0.72), ('say', 0.72), ('things', 0.71), ('house', 0.71), ('ve', 0.71), ('life', 0.7), ('times', 0.69), ('investigation', 0.67), ('countries', 0.65), ('money', 0.65), ('come', 0.64), ('ago', 0.64), ('foreign', 0.64), ('did', 0.63), ('lot', 0.61), ('attacks', 0.6), ('group', 0.6), ('year', 0.6), ('got', 0.59), ('criminal', 0.58), ('used', 0.58), ('including', 0.58), ('end', 0.58), ('need', 0.57), ('terrorism', 0.57), ('war', 0.57), ('power', 0.57), ('terror', 0.57), ('called', 0.56), ('state', 0.55), ('better', 0.55), ('work', 0.55), ('left', 0.55), ('case', 0.55), ('authorities', 0.55), ('use', 0.54), ('death', 0.54), ('arrested', 0.54), ('day', 0.53), ('attack', 0.53), ('help', 0.53), ('groups', 0.53), ('forces', 0.52), ('media', 0.52), ('film', 0.51), ('later', 0.51), ('came', 0.51), ('leaders', 0.5), ('charges', 0.49), ('terrorists', 0.49), ('market', 0.49), ('big', 0.49), ('far', 0.49), ('million', 0.48), ('car', 0.48), ('home', 0.48), ('place', 0.48), ('early', 0.46), ('intelligence', 0.46), ('took', 0.46), ('agency', 0.46), ('man', 0.46), ('killing', 0.45), ('violence', 0.45), ('months', 0.44), ('question', 0.43), ('black', 0.43), ('pay', 0.43), ('important', 0.43), ('sports', 0.43), ('area', 0.43), ('set', 0.42), ('different', 0.42), ('told', 0.42), ('thought', 0.41), ('ll', 0.4), ('statement', 0.4), ('near', 0.39), ('white', 0.39), ('especially', 0.39), ('official', 0.39), ('questions', 0.39), ('old', 0.39), ('asked', 0.39), ('region', 0.39), ('fact', 0.39), ('plan', 0.39), ('past', 0.38), ('star', 0.38), ('half', 0.38), ('according', 0.38), ('outside', 0.38), ('days', 0.38), ('saying', 0.38), ('began', 0.37), ('known', 0.37), ('south', 0.37), ('week', 0.37), ('members', 0.37), ('line', 0.37), ('small', 0.37), ('role', 0.36), ('rate', 0.36), ('thousands', 0.36), ('said', 0.35), ('chief', 0.35), ('face', 0.35), ('open', 0.35), ('program', 0.35), ('using', 0.35), ('building', 0.34), ('recent', 0.34), ('close', 0.34), ('recently', 0.34), ('given', 0.34), ('water', 0.34), ('effort', 0.33), ('actor', 0.33), ('possible', 0.33), ('spokesman', 0.32), ('moment', 0.32), ('control', 0.32), ('study', 0.32), ('force', 0.32), ('able', 0.32), ('agencies', 0.32), ('weeks', 0.31), ('leave', 0.31), ('worked', 0.31), ('team', 0.31), ('order', 0.31), ('win', 0.3), ('try', 0.3), ('ways', 0.3), ('number', 0.3), ('north', 0.3), ('turn', 0.29), ('believe', 0.29), ('meeting', 0.29), ('head', 0.29), ('areas', 0.29), ('experience', 0.29), ('process', 0.28), ('hours', 0.28), ('based', 0.28), ('play', 0.28), ('approach', 0.28), ('sea', 0.28), ('feet', 0.27), ('current', 0.27), ('hand', 0.27), ('member', 0.27), ('global', 0.27), ('received', 0.27), ('plans', 0.26), ('led', 0.26), ('moved', 0.26), ('social', 0.26), ('stars', 0.26), ('soon', 0.26), ('taken', 0.26), ('lost', 0.26), ('border', 0.26), ('view', 0.25), ('lead', 0.25), ('ban', 0.25), ('longer', 0.25), ('quickly', 0.25), ('free', 0.24), ('create', 0.24), ('played', 0.24), ('story', 0.24), ('considered', 0.24), ('built', 0.24), ('main', 0.23), ('wants', 0.23), ('act', 0.23), ('potential', 0.23), ('means', 0.23), ('answer', 0.22), ('injuries', 0.22), ('record', 0.22), ('book', 0.22), ('standing', 0.21), ('similar', 0.21), ('overall', 0.21), ('leaving', 0.2), ('hold', 0.2), ('attention', 0.19), ('meet', 0.19), ('word', 0.19), ('eat', 0.19), ('track', 0.19), ('era', 0.18), ('seven', 0.17), ('battle', 0.17), ('figure', 0.17), ('restaurant', 0.17), ('store', 0.16), ('language', 0.16), ('willing', 0.16), ('adding', 0.16), ('prepared', 0.15), ('wearing', 0.15), ('apartment', 0.14), ('doors', 0.14), ('fellow', 0.12), ('suggest', 0.12), ('covered', 0.1), ('volunteers', 0.07)]), 3470: ('JUBA, South Sudan  —   At a sprawling displacement camp on the outskirts of the capital, women have faced a wrenching choice: risk starvation or sexual assault. When her family ran out of food last month, Angelina Nhokmar, a    mother of two, ventured outside the camp’s gates. She said she was lucky to have made it to the market and back unharmed, because dozens of women were raped by government soldiers in recent weeks as they made the same journey. “It’s not safe,” she said, tossing handfuls of sorghum into a pot of boiling water. “Our enemies are outside. ” The civil war that ripped apart South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, ended on paper months ago. But an eruption of clashes between the country’s rival factions in July put a chokehold on regular food distribution for the tens of thousands of people stranded in United   displacement camps. As families struggled to find sustenance, they endured an increase in health care crises, ethnic tensions and sexual violence. Nearly 30, 000 people have been sheltering at United Nations sites around the capital, Juba, since South Sudan erupted into civil war in 2013. For more than two years, soldiers loyal to President Salva Kiir  —   who belongs to the Dinka ethnic group, South Sudan’s largest  —   battled troops led by Riek Machar of the Nuer ethnic group, which is believed to be the second largest. Tens of thousands of people lost their lives in the war, and troops on both sides committed human rights abuses against civilians on a devastating scale. A peace deal officially ended the fighting last year. Mr. Machar, who had served as vice president before being fired in 2013, agreed to become Mr. Kiir’s deputy again and moved back to Juba in April. But then fighting broke out again between the two sides on July 7, killing hundreds. Mr. Machar’s residence was destroyed, and he fled the capital. He has refused to return to Juba unless more international troops are deployed. Mr. Kiir opposes this, arguing that the 12, 000 United Nations peacekeeping troops already stationed here are enough. For years, the displacement camps have been worlds unto themselves: communities complete with churches, shops and schools. But they are also plagued by overcrowding, recurring shortages of basic goods, and the uncertainty faced by residents who have no idea when, if ever, they will feel safe enough to leave. So they stay, cloistered inside   fences guarded by United Nations troops who have failed to keep peace in the capital or even to prevent assaults just outside the camps’ perimeters. Sexual assaults in Juba surged last month, to at least 217 reported cases, the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad   said Thursday in a statement. Members of South Sudan’s own national army, he said, seemed to be responsible for most of the assaults. And most of the victims, he added, were displaced Nuer women and girls. Many were women living in the camps who ventured out to the markets when food ran out. Others were fleeing the clashes and making their way to the displacement sites for the first time. The civilians who came to these camps in 2013 were overwhelmingly Nuer. Last week, thousands of them demonstrated against Mr. Kiir for recognizing a new vice president to take Mr. Machar’s place, calling it a violation of the peace deal. Such a gathering would be unimaginable now in central Juba. The streets of the capital are firmly under the control of the president’s forces, though they are still tense. Many properties have been destroyed, and many more looted  —   often by men wearing army uniforms. International partners have also suffered, including the United Nations peacekeeping mission, which lost two Chinese soldiers to crossfire inside the camp last month, and the World Food Program, whose main warehouse in South Sudan was looted from top to bottom in one of the worst such episodes the organization has experienced in years. It wasn’t just the food, which totaled about 4, 500 metric tons and consisted mostly of nutritional supplements for children and pregnant or nursing mothers, according to a spokeswoman, Challiss McDonough. “Everything was stripped,” she said. “Technical equipment, generators, fuel stocks  —   every single thing was gone. ” Also stolen were several trucks specially outfitted to deliver food across the country, a   task for normal vehicles in the current rainy season. That means the warehouse looting in Juba, which would have required a herculean effort involving hundreds of people over several days, will have ripple effects all across this desperately hungry country. Last week, the World Food Program, which still has a smaller warehouse in the vicinity of the capital, delivered a new shipment of food to the camps. But there is not enough for everyone. People said they had been asked to share their rations with thousands of newcomers. This has led to some friction, said Charles Longa, 25, a new arrival. Like many of the most recently displaced, he is not Nuer but Equatorian, a catchall term encompassing ethnic groups from the country’s diverse south. “The people who have been living here for a long time are telling us we’d better go home,” he said, blaming food shortages for the rising tensions. “We Equatorians don’t want to be in here, begging. We want to be out there, farming. ” Like many other new arrivals, Mr. Longa and his children had not yet been given a tent and were sheltering in a school in the center of the largest displacement site. He said he feared for his safety when, shortly after he arrived, an Equatorian was blamed for a killing just outside the camp, spurring a brief protest outside the school. William Tejok Toch, a community leader in the camp, acknowledged that the schoolyard had briefly been targeted, requiring intervention from United Nations police officers. “In the camps, we have our criminals,” he said. “But we manage the situation. ” Some who fled the clashes last month crowded into schools and churches in Juba, saying they did not want to risk the journey to the United Nations camps. Others said they had made the dangerous trek, but were turned away. “If you give shelter, you should give it to everyone,” said Azen Aziuphia, 41, who said that he, his wife and his son had been denied entry. He accused the peacekeepers of refusing to admit Equatorians like him, though the United Nations says it does not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity. The United Nations humanitarian chief, Stephen O’Brien, acknowledged that the sites had limited space, and that the registration of newcomers had been slow. He added that the camps were meant to accommodate only those with nowhere else to go. The camps were caught in the crossfire during the clashes last month, and at least 16 people died. Some families have buried loved ones on the edges of the camp, just beyond a coil of barbed wire. Now, the refuge is hemmed in on two sides by rows of shallow graves topped with makeshift crosses. Gatleak Jal, 32, who fled to the camp in 2013, suspects that Mr. Kiir’s troops deliberately targeted the United Nations sites. When gunshots were fired just beyond the walls three weeks ago, he was shot three times in the arm as he ran toward his tent, and then two times more  —   once in the abdomen, once in the leg  —   after he ducked into a trench for shelter. In a crowded medical center inside the camp, he lifted his shirt to reveal a patchwork of bloody bandages. “They didn’t put any medicine on this, because they ran out,” he said. “They’re only washing it with water. ” Mr. Longa, the new arrival, grew wistful thinking about the three brothers he had lost in three separate conflicts. One died in the war for independence against Sudan, another in the civil war two years ago, and one more in clashes last month, he said. All three were members of the army, he added. But now he wonders what they were fighting for. “We used to go to war for land, or for freedom,” he said. “But now they are confusing us, and making it about tribe. ”', [('new', 3.26), ('police', 2.26), ('don', 1.84), ('years', 1.82), ('like', 1.72), ('time', 1.5), ('just', 1.49), ('think', 1.47), ('know', 1.46), ('government', 1.33), ('people', 1.32), ('want', 1.23), ('long', 1.22), ('make', 1.2), ('world', 1.19), ('way', 1.18), ('ms', 1.15), ('president', 1.14), ('country', 1.09), ('children', 1.07), ('family', 1.07), ('good', 1.06), ('say', 1.05), ('house', 1.04), ('ve', 1.03), ('officers', 1.01), ('times', 1.0), ('mother', 0.95), ('come', 0.94), ('ago', 0.93), ('did', 0.92), ('didn', 0.9), ('group', 0.88), ('year', 0.87), ('criminal', 0.86), ('used', 0.84), ('including', 0.84), ('end', 0.84), ('war', 0.83), ('state', 0.81), ('better', 0.81), ('work', 0.81), ('case', 0.8), ('does', 0.79), ('use', 0.79), ('day', 0.78), ('groups', 0.77), ('forces', 0.76), ('came', 0.74), ('market', 0.72), ('far', 0.71), ('away', 0.71), ('car', 0.7), ('home', 0.7), ('place', 0.7), ('young', 0.69), ('center', 0.69), ('child', 0.68), ('early', 0.68), ('man', 0.67), ('killing', 0.66), ('school', 0.66), ('increase', 0.66), ('violence', 0.65), ('rights', 0.65), ('making', 0.65), ('months', 0.64), ('office', 0.6), ('medical', 0.59), ('ll', 0.59), ('statement', 0.59), ('official', 0.57), ('old', 0.57), ('asked', 0.57), ('fact', 0.56), ('won', 0.56), ('star', 0.56), ('according', 0.55), ('outside', 0.55), ('days', 0.55), ('saying', 0.55), ('south', 0.55), ('week', 0.55), ('members', 0.54), ('small', 0.53), ('rate', 0.52), ('thousands', 0.52), ('said', 0.52), ('chief', 0.52), ('face', 0.52), ('food', 0.51), ('health', 0.51), ('using', 0.51), ('recent', 0.5), ('recently', 0.5), ('love', 0.5), ('given', 0.49), ('water', 0.49), ('effort', 0.48), ('makes', 0.48), ('control', 0.47), ('force', 0.47), ('able', 0.46), ('weeks', 0.46), ('leave', 0.46), ('try', 0.44), ('turn', 0.43), ('believe', 0.43), ('vehicle', 0.43), ('experience', 0.42), ('protest', 0.42), ('risk', 0.41), ('sea', 0.4), ('community', 0.4), ('current', 0.4), ('hand', 0.4), ('lives', 0.4), ('member', 0.39), ('church', 0.39), ('led', 0.38), ('moved', 0.38), ('lost', 0.38), ('lead', 0.37), ('ban', 0.37), ('ii', 0.36), ('large', 0.36), ('free', 0.36), ('schools', 0.35), ('grew', 0.35), ('main', 0.34), ('act', 0.33), ('means', 0.33), ('space', 0.32), ('hold', 0.29), ('era', 0.27), ('battle', 0.25), ('wearing', 0.21), ('shop', 0.18), ('demonstrated', 0.1)]), 33947: (' (CNN) Two police officers in Georgia were fired Thursday, less than 24 hours after cell phone videos surfaced of them punching and kicking a motorist in handcuffs.  No charges have been filed, but the Gwinnett County Police Department said it’s moving forward with a criminal investigation into the incident in the suburban Atlanta county. On Wednesday, Sgt. Michael Bongiovanni pulled over motorist Demetrius Hollins in a routine traffic stop, according to police Chief Butch Ayers.  In his report, Bongiovanni said the vehicle did not have a license plate and continued moving as he tried to pull it over.  The officer said the vehicle appeared to stall, and he got out to speak to the driver and could smell marijuana. He wrote that Hollins was acting strange and started yelling, ”I need my mom.” Bongiovanni, who’s been on the force 19 years, wrote he ordered Hollins out of the car, but a struggle ensued.  ”Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back, spun around and began to actively resist arrest by bending at the waist and trying to push me away,” he wrote in the incident report.  The officer said he had to use a Taser on Hollins and put handcuffs on him while he was on the ground. Bongiovanni also wrote he remembers detaining the same man in a previous traffic stop, and the man was allegedly found with a loaded gun.  ”In my previous encounter he reached for a loaded firearm that was under his seat,” he wrote in his report.  Witness video, In a cell phone video shot by a witness that emerged Wednesday night, Officer Robert McDonald, who was responding to assist Bongiovanni, emerges from offscreen and kicks Hollins while he is on the ground. The department says an investigation into McDonald’s actions was launched immediately, and he was fired by midafternoon Thursday. But the trouble for the department did not end there. During the investigation, a second video surfaced, shot from a different angle by another witness. In this video, Bongiovanni can be seen approaching Hollins, who is still inside the car.  As Hollins exits the vehicle with his hands up, the officer punches him in the face.     As Hollins left the Gwinnett County Jail with a bloodied face Thursday, he told CNN affiliate   in Atlanta, ”All I can say is, I wish this had never happened to me.” Officers questioned, The police department’s internal affairs unit questioned Bongiovanni and McDonald about their actions, Ayers said.  McDonald was forthcoming, saying he was wrong for kicking Hollins. But Bongiovanni said in written documents and   interviews that a struggle occurred between him and Hollins, according to the police chief.  Bongiovanni was let go by the department for his actions and for lying to investigators, according to Ayers.  Both officers did not respond immediately to CNN requests for comment. On Friday, the county’s solicitor general dismissed 89 cases in which the two officers were the principal officers or necessary witnesses. ’That punch was unreasonable’ The chief said he was disturbed by what he saw in the videos and by the actions of his officers. ”(Bongiovanni) had the opportunity to tell us what happened in the report and when he was interviewed by internal affairs. He said nothing about a punch. In this case, what we saw on video, that punch was unreasonable and unnecessary.” Ayers said when Bongiovanni was asked about the discrepancies in his account and the newly surfaced video, he replied, ”It’s different on the streets.”  Ayers said, he was stunned. ”I am almost for a loss of words for what we had to go through today for the unwarranted actions of two of my officers,” he said.  ”We’ve put a lot of money into recruiting, training and equipping them, and there is literally no excuse for behavior like this. This is not what we teach in the academy. This is not what we expect from our officers, and we aren’t going to put up with it.” McDonald joined the force in 2013 and received high marks from Bongiovanni, his supervisor, during his last performance evaluation.  The evaluation said McDonald ”always deals with members of the community in a courteous, professional, calm and controlled manner.”  The police department said it has launched a criminal investigation that will be sent to the Gwinnett County district attorney’s office.  ”What happened yesterday was clearly outside of state law and department policy,” police said in a statement.

On Thursday, he filed a proposed   lawsuit against the city of Baton Rouge and several law enforcement agencies. The suit, in which Mr. Mckesson is joined as a named plaintiff by two other protesters who were also arrested, says that the police “employed unconstitutional tactics to disturb, disrupt, infringe upon and criminalize” the constitutional rights of assembly and free speech. Mr. Mckesson was arrested July 9, four days after the shooting of the man, Alton Sterling, and as demonstrations had been growing in Baton Rouge. The night he was arrested, on the grounds of “simple obstruction of a highway of commerce,” more than 100 people were also arrested, mostly on the same charge. Mr. Mckesson was held overnight and released the next day. About a week later, the parish prosecutor announced that he would drop charges against Mr. Mckesson and about 100 of the 185 people who had been arrested during the protests. Like Mr. Mckesson, the two other named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Gloria La Riva of San Francisco and Kira Marrero of Louisiana, were arrested on the   charge, which was later dropped. The suit, which seeks to represent all those arrested on this charge during the July protests, demands the removal of the arrests from criminal records and the reimbursement of bond payments, lawyers’ fees and other costs paid by the plaintiffs. The defendants include Mayor Kip Holden of Baton Rouge the city’s police chief, Carl Dabadie Jr. the parish sheriff and the superintendent of the Louisiana State Police. A spokesman for the mayor’s office could not be reached for comment, and a Baton Rouge Police Department spokesman would not comment. Mr. Mckesson’s lawsuit followed another one concerning the Baton Rouge protests, by the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. That suit seeks a court order to change the way police respond to protests. Responding to the July protests, which were nearly all peaceful,   officers in Baton Rouge wore riot gear, carried long guns and made arrests on private property. Their tactics have drawn intense criticism, but city officials defended them, citing suspected violent plots against the police. On July 17, a former Marine angered over police shootings traveled to Baton Rouge from Missouri and shot six law enforcement officers, killing three.', [('police', 5.96), ('court', 3.74), ('officials', 3.62), ('people', 3.48), ('long', 3.2), ('way', 3.11), ('law', 3.08), ('say', 2.77), ('ve', 2.72), ('officers', 2.65), ('lot', 2.36), ('criminal', 2.25), ('end', 2.22), ('arrested', 2.06), ('day', 2.06), ('change', 1.99), ('later', 1.97), ('charges', 1.91), ('night', 1.89), ('car', 1.85), ('shooting', 1.84), ('early', 1.78), ('man', 1.75), ('killing', 1.74), ('rights', 1.71), ('pay', 1.67), ('speech', 1.62), ('office', 1.59), ('nearly', 1.55), ('ll', 1.55), ('near', 1.52), ('official', 1.51), ('old', 1.5), ('high', 1.47), ('outside', 1.45), ('days', 1.45), ('week', 1.44), ('cost', 1.42), ('chief', 1.36), ('private', 1.25), ('spokesman', 1.24), ('force', 1.23), ('agencies', 1.21), ('order', 1.18), ('win', 1.17), ('protest', 1.09), ('movement', 1.01), ('led', 1.01), ('free', 0.93), ('act', 0.88), ('record', 0.84), ('follow', 0.81), ('era', 0.71), ('store', 0.63)]), 33953: (' (CNN) Police on Long Island, New York, have discovered the bodies of four young people authorities suspect may have been killed by members of the international   gang, officials said Thursday. Authorities believe the four males, ranging from ages 16 to 20, were killed several days ago in a park in Central Islip, a   community about 47 miles east of New York City. Suffolk County Police found the bodies late Wednesday in a wooded area. It wasn’t immediately clear what led them to the park.  The victims ”suffered from significant trauma throughout their body with a sharp or edged instrument,” county Police Commissioner Timothy Sini said.  ”The manner in which they were killed is consistent with the modus operandi of ” Sini told reporters.   also known as La Mara Salvatrucha, is one of the largest criminal organizations in the United States, with more than 6, 000 members in at least 46 states and the District of Columbia, the US Attorney’s Office said.  In addition, more than 30, 000   members operate internationally, mostly in El Salvador, Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala.    uses violence to intimidate rival gangs, using weapons ranging from firearms to machetes.  Sini said police are not ruling out any possibilities in the investigation. He announced a $25, 000 reward for information that helps solve the case.  One family told CNN affiliate WPIX it believed their missing teenager was among the dead. Police have not released the victims’ identities. ’This is a   war’ The discovery of the bodies comes about a month after more than a dozen   members were indicted in seven killings on Long Island over three years, including the deaths of several high school students last year. Two of the students    Nisa Mickens, 15, and Kayla Cuevas, 16    were beaten with baseball bats and a machete in September in nearby Brentwood.  Kayla had been involved in ”disputes” with   gang members and associates, including a recent altercation at Brentwood High School, where the girls attended classes. The girls had gone for a walk the night they were killed, CNN affiliate News 12 Long Island reported.  A third Brentwood High School student, Jose Pena, 18, was killed on June 3 because he had been suspected of violating gang rules, authorities said. His remains were discovered in October. The gang, which federal authorities said is a ”transnational criminal enterprise,” became so powerful that the FBI started a   National Gang Task Force in 2004. ”We’re under no illusion that   is still operating in Suffolk County. No doubt, we’ve made tremendous progress,” Sini said. He added: ”But this is a   war. And make no mistake about it, it’s a war,” Sini said.

[ —    In her closing, Clinton vows to take on the   barriers. She will take on the healthcare barriers and do everything we can to “unite the country” and will “find common ground. ” She says she will “stand my ground” wherever matters of principles are at stake. Sanders asks if it acceptable that 58% of all new income is going to the to 1% and Wall Street is spending billions of dollars to try and buy elections  …     he asks is that democracy or oligarchy  …     he wants public funding of elections. He also asks if it is right that students can’t afford to go to college and are so deeply in debt int he wealthiest country in the history of the world. Sanders says if we “fight back, stand up, we can do a lot better. That’s why I’m running, 10:50: Clinton asked what qualifications she would look for in a Sup. Ct. Justice. She supports Obama’s intention to nominate Scalia’s replacement. She says no state should realize the importance more than Florida. She has three words: “Bush versus Gore. ” She says the “a Court took away the presidency. Now we got the Republican Congress trying to take away the Constitution. And we should not tolerate that. ” She wants someone with “heart” and “life experiences” who believes that Roe v. Wade is settled law and would overturn Citizens United. 10:48: When asked about Puerto Rico, Clinton says Puerto Ricans are citizens of America and they deserve to be treated like citizens. She says Congress must give authority to Puerto Rico to restructure its debt and it is a “grave injustice” for the   Congress not to do so. She now slams Sanders for praising the “revolution of values” in Cuba. She says “couldn’t disagree more” and if the values are if you oppress people, disappear people, even kill people for expressing their points of view  …     then “That’s not the kind of revolution of values I want to see anywhere,” she says. 10:43: Sanders shown a clip of himself praising Castro. He is booed. Questioner says there are still open wounds among exiles and what is the difference between the socialism he professes and the socialism in Cuba and other Latin American countries. Sanders says what he was talking about in the clip was the U. S. was wrong to try to invade Cuba, overthrow the   governments. He says  he opposed Kissinger and attempts to overthrow Allende, etc. Sanders says all of these actions in Latin America brought forth a lot of   sentiment. When Sanders is asked whether he regrets his praise of Messrs. Castro and Ortega, he dodges. He says Cuba is an    country, but he says that it would be wrong not to state the Cuba has made advances in health care. Full diplomatic relations, he says, will improve the lives of Cuba, 10:39: Ramos asks his “Welcome to Miami” question. She asks both candidates whether they would meet with dissidents in Cuba. And would they meet with Fidel Castro and would they consider Raul Castro a president or dictator. Clinton says she supported Obama’s Cuba agenda —  expanding travel opportunities, remittances —  and she says she told Obama she hoped he would move the countries closer re: diplomatic relations. She says meeting with dissidents is “important” and the “Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld. ” She says both Castors have to be considered dictator since they are not chosen by the people. Sanders says he understands that not everyone will agree him but he thinks we should end the embargo and move toward “full and normalized” political relations with Cuba. He says it will be a good thing for the Cuban people. 10:33: Tumulty says Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) has said “personnel is policy. ” [No, Tumulty —  that was Morton Blackwell]  …     she asks about the revolving door between Wall     levels of economic policy making. She asks Clinton if she agrees with Warren’s criticism that they rely too much on those who represent the worldview of the big banks. She wants to end the revolving door and will look for people who will do more to look out for consumers and ensure Main Street flourishes. She asks Sanders to criticize George W. Bush instead of criticizing   Clinton for wrecking the economy and causing the great recession. Sanders says nobody has opposed Bush more than he has and says he doesn’t think Clinton has been listening to his speeches. 10:28: Debate turns to Climate change as Tumulty, who seems like it is her goal tonight to harm Republicans so a Democrat gets elected, gives   opportunities to blast Republicans on climate change. Sanders says Republicans lose funding if they believe in climate change. Clinton says she would use more executive actions on climate change to build a bridge from coal to natural gas and clean energy. She wants to invest in “resilience” and “mitigation” to deal with the high sea levels in Miami. “Excuse me,” Clinton says as Sanders tries to interrupt, giving Sanders a taste of his own medicine. Sanders wants a “tax on carbon” as well. He calls on Clinton to join him in opposing fracking. And Tumulty moves the debate along. 10:25: Clinton says her father said “if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. ” She blasts Sanders for not having clear plans on how to pay for his programs. Sanders says what Clinton is saying is the U. S. should not guarantee everyone health care. “You may not think that the American people are prepared to stand up the insurance companies or the drug companies,” Sanders says, adding that the American people are. Bizarre attack on Sanders against the person who promoted “Hilllarycare. ” 10:22: Clinton’s cough returns as she talks about her plans to reduce student debt. She says the government has to quit making money lending money to young people. Sanders says Clinton is absolutely right and points out that he said it many months before she said it. Sanders says he has been criticized for talking about big ideas and he says that his “free college” plan is a “fairly expensive proposal” ($70 billion a year) and he will pay for it with a tax on Wall Street speculation. 10:19: Sanders says Trump’s children and Clinton’s children should be able to go to public colleges for free but suggests they would probably choose private schools. Clinton has said she opposed Sanders’s “free college” plan because her  ’s family should not be able to go to college for free since they can afford the tuition. 10:17: Sanders says we have a big problem with youth unemployment in the    communities. [Sanders has said in the past that immigration was one of the reasons for this but he won’t dare say that now or at this debate.] He calls for raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing health care as a right. 10:12: When asked why voters should prefer a career politician like Sanders over an establishment one like Clinton, he says it depends on what his career has been about. He says he has stood up for the environment, seniors, workers and stood up to special interests all his life. He says, unlike Clinton, he believes we should expand social security. 10:01: Audience boos Ramos as he asks Clinton about Benghazi. He points out the Clinton sent emails to her family saying Benghazi was a terrorist attack while lying the families of the attacks that a “video” was responsible. Ramos asks if she lied to the families of the victims. Clinton says the families of the victims are wrong. She says she testified for 11 hours and Republicans didn’t learn anything new. [Give Ramos credit on this question —  much tougher line of questioning than other mainstream media journalists.] Clinton says at the time she emailed Chelsea, a terrorist group on social media had claimed responsibility and they rescinded it later [This type of response will get her in trouble. And what does that say about her State Department? ]. She also insists the video had a role in the attack, Sanders blasts Clinton for wanting to win the praise of Kissinger and for intervening in Libya. 9:59: Sanders says the head of Goldman Sachs said he was dangerous and he says in fact he is “dangerous” for Wall Street. Clinton hits Sanders for opposing the   bank [how many voters actually care about this? ]. Sanders says he opposed “corporate welfare. ” 9:53: Tumulty asks Sanders why it is important for Clinton to release her Wall Street transcripts. Sanders says she got paid $250, 000 to give speeches to banks that ruined the economy. Sanders says the speech must have been so great that she would want to share it with the American people. Tumulty asks Sanders if he thinks Clinton is saying one thing to Wall Street and one thing to the public. Sanders says that is why we need to see the transcripts. Sanders says every politician who takes   funds says they are not influenced. [Tumulty steps in like the manager at ring side to say “time is up” as Sanders gets going on his attack against Clinton’s ties to crony   Street.] Sanders says Clinton’s words to Wall Street have intimidated them and that is why they have given her at least $15 million in contributions. Clinton says that it is worth pointing out that the Koch Brothers, the leaders of the fossil fuels industry, have out out an ad praising Sanders. Sanders says “there is nobody in the United States Congress who has taken on the Koch Brothers”  …     more than Bernie Sanders. 9:52: Tumulty [she also conveniently lets everyone know that Clinton says her numbers are so low because Republicans have incessantly attacked her for 20 years  …     now Clinton doesn’t need to whine about that. MSM being MSM] asks questions about why people don’t find her trustworthy. She wonders if she has done anything to “foster this mistrust. ” Clinton says she takes responsibility and says “this is not easy for me. ” She says it is not easy to try to help people and try to “even the odds. ” “I am not a natural politician,” Clinton says. Saying she doesn’t have the natural skills of Obama and her husband. She is just as much a politician, though. [embodies the worst traits  …     she just lacks their charisma.] 9:50: Questioner asks Clinton what her plan is to unite families with their children. Clinton says the audience member is “brave”  …     “an incredible act of courage” that not many people understand. Clinton says she has heard similar stories. She says she will do whatever she can to unite families and hopes the questioner’s children were either born in this country or eligible for Obama’s executive amnesty. 9:49: Audience member asks Sanders what he would do to reunite families and stop deportations. Sanders says the essence of what he is trying to do is to “unite families, not to divide families. ” He says the idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is “wrong” and “immoral. ” Sanders says a young man’s wife was deported while he was serving in the military and that is unconscionable. He says he will do whatever he can to unite children with their mothers, 9:47: Sanders says we should not resort to “racism” and “xenophobia” like Trump when talking about immigration. He calls Trump’s plan to deport illegal immigrants “vulgar” and something people should not take seriously. 9:45: Clinton is pressed on what the difference is between the wall that she voted for and Trump’s wall. She says the difference is Trump is talking about a  “very tall wall” that is “better than the Great Wall of China” that he would magically get Mexico to pay for. She says it’s fantasy. Clinton says she supported some fencing and other measures to improve security. Complete dodge. 9:39: Sanders wants to go back to the ’07 amnesty bill. Sanders wonders why LULAC and “other major Latino organizations” would oppose the bill if it was such a great bill for immigrants. Sanders says he worked on legislation to make sure   were not treated like “slaves. ” Clinton, seeming like a coughing fit is coming, says the the UFW said the ’07 bill was the “lsat, best hope. ” She now says Sanders supported “indefinite detention” and stood with “minutemen vigilantes” in their efforts to “hunt down immigrants. ” Ramos asks Sanders, “did you support the minutemen?” Sanders replies, “of course not. ” He accuses Clinton of taking large pieces of legislation and taking stuff out of it. Sanders says he did not oppose the bailouts and did not support the minutemen. She says that is a “horrific statement” to make. Debate is getting testy as Sanders is finally showing the life he should have shown over the summer. He actually seems like he wants to win the nomination. He says he will put up his record of fighting for the poor against Clinton’s any time. Sanders blasts Clinton for wanting to bail out Wall Street. CLINTON IS NOW TALKING LIKE  A SENATOR on minutiae re: the auto bailout. This is why it is so rare for Senators —  or those who talk like Senators —  to get elected President. Obama didn’t talk like a Senator on the stump. Trump doesn’t talk like one either. 9:37: When Sanders is asked the question, Sanders says Clinton didn’t fully answer the question and “the proof may be in the pudding. ” Sanders says Honduras may be the most violent region in our hemisphere. He says children fled that part of the world to try to meet up with their families here  …     yet Clinton “did not support those children coming into the country. I did. ” Sanders says he will not deport children from the United States. Sanders says he can also promise not to deport illegal immigrants without criminal records. [This debate is pushing Democrats to the left, and it may not be good for them in this year’s general election.] 9:34: Ramos says Clinton has twice not promised that she will definitely not deport children. He says she seems to be defending Obama’s immigration policies. He asks if Clinton will promise that she will not deport children and illegal immigrants with a criminal record. Ramos asks for a “yes or no” answer. Clinton says “yes, you can. ” [Unintentionally kind of evokes Obama’s slogan] She says she wants to deport terrorists, criminals, and anyone who threatens our security. But she doesn’t answer “yes or no. ” And when pressed, Clinton says she will not deport children and families. Clinton says she will also not deport illegal immigrants who do not have criminal records. 9:25: Sanders is asked about why he voted against  . He says he voted against it because the   programs would  have been akin to slavery. He praises the Southern Poverty Law Center, which many have criticized. He says he supported the Gang of Eight bill. Sanders says he will use executive actions to expand on Obama’s programs. Sanders says LULAC also opposed that bill. Clinton says it’s very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, “Barack Obama, me, La Raza,” the UFW, Dolores Huerta would have supported a bill that would have ushered in a program that was akin to modern slavery. She says that was just an excuse not to vote for the bill. Sanders points out that Clinton was against driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants [that issue derailed her campaign in 2008 —  see Russert’s questioning and Chris Dodd’s response.] Sanders also points out that Clinton wanted the illegal immigrant children who flooded across the border to be sent back. [Clinton can’t try to take the high ground on immigration when she, t0o, has been all over the map. You can tell Sanders has been well briefed on this —  and well aware of Clinton’s   of staffers like DREAMer Erika Andiola that he hired.] Clinton now accuses Sanders again of siding with the “vigilante Minutemen. ” Clinton says one of the first things Sanders did when he first arrived in the Senate was to vote against Kennedy’s immigration bill. Sanders says Kennedy was a very close friend of his and points out that the exposed the   working conditions to improve wages when Kennedy was kind enough to let him hold hearings re: illegal immigrant tomato pickers in Florida. 9:22: Questioner asks Clinton if she has been “Hispandering” by pandering to them on immigration. Clinton says she sponsored the “DREAMer Act” and she claims she has been “consistent and committed” to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. She says she thought the best chance for comprehensive amnesty legislation was in 2007 and she voted for the   bill while Sanders voted against it. She asks the audience to imagine how much better they would have been had the amnesty bill passed in 2007. 9:20: Tumulty now asks Sanders if it is fair to call Trump a racist. Sanders says Trump tried to delegitimize Obama with the birther  movement. Sanders says he does not think Americans will elect someone who is intolerant. Tumulty wants the Democrats to slime Trump. “What does that tell you about his character,” Tumulty annoying presses Sanders (warning to msm: this type of questioning will backfire on you in the general election. The American people don’t like media figures like Tumulty). Sanders says he is leading Trump by 18 points. 9:19:   Tumulty wants to make sure she gets her shots in at Trump. Clinton says Trump’s has been “ ” by calling for things like temporary ban on Muslims. 9:17: Karen Tumulty asks Clinton if Trump is a racist. Clinton says there will be a lot of time to talk about Trump if she is the nominee. She says she called him out when Trump. She points out that she said “Basta (enough)” after Trump’s comments about illegal immigration and then blasts him for not clearly disavowing David Duke’s endorsement. 9:17: Sanders says he will focus on the working families in America and let the process sort itself out. 9:16: Clinton: “Oh, for goodness. I’m not going to answer the question. That’s not going to happen. ” Clinton’s response when Ramos asks if she will drop out if she is indicted. 9:13: RAMOS DISCLOSES HIS DAUGHTER WORKS FOR CLINTON’S CAMPAIGN. He then asks Clinton about her email scandal and asks who gave her permission to operate a private server. He asks if she will drop out of the race if she is indicted. Clinton says she will give the same answer that she has been giving for months. Clinton says she did not send or receive any emails “MARKED classified” at that time and people are talking about “retroactive classification. ” 9:12: Sanders says “we have come a long way in ten months. ” He said his victory in Michigan was one of the major political  upsets in modern history. He says his message is resonating across this country and he will do “extremely well” in the upcoming primaries. He says he will convince   that he is the best candidate to defeat Trump. 9:11: Clinton says she won 100, 000 more votes and more delegates than Sanders. She says it is a marathon and says she is running an “inclusive campaign” [Tony Lee: Sanders, though, was the person who has hired top amnesty advocates and Black Lives Matter advocates to help him better reach out to minorities.] Clinton was asked that she may have thought she was the nominee but voters may have said “not so fast” last night. 9:01: Univision’s debate starts. Jorge Ramos is one of the moderators. Clinton says she has been looking forward to this debate. She wants to discuss how to knock down the barriers that prevent people from getting ahead and staying ahead. Clinton says comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship will be one of her priorities in the first 100 days. Sanders says it is just too late for “establishment politics and economics. ” He starts the Univision debate by blasting Citizens United again. Sanders says “of course, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship. ” [The debate is sponsored by Univision and Facebook. You can guess where the questions will be going on immigration.] 8:50: Trump says he’ll debate Cruz in a    debate. He says Cruz is a “bad talker” but a pretty good debater. He calls Cruz a phony. “I don’t mind debating him at all. ” Trump says tomorrow’s debate will be “softer” and he says Rubio will be a different person because he has been “mortally wounded. ” Trump says Kasich said he was going to win Michigan but he lost. “He didn’t even come in second,” Trump says. 8:48: Trump says he is “far and away the frontrunner. ” He says the worst thing the GOP can do is knock him out because the party will lose all of the new voters that he is attracting. He says he will beat Hillary because he will win states like New York, Florida, and Ohio, 8:45: Trump says he sells the steaks through his clubs. He says he buys the steaks and “we’re not going to kill the cow. ” He adds, “we do a tremendous steak business. ” He says he buys his steaks from a lot of different places. 8:40: Trump says going after the families of terrorists is the only way to stop it. “We have to be a lot tougher,” Trump says. “We are playing with a different set of rules. ” He says ISIS chops off people’s heads and we can’t even waterboard. Trump says we have to expand laws but that does not mean “cutting off heads. ” He points out that ISIS has no rules while we are bound by restrictive rules. Trump blasts Gen. Hayden, who has criticized his foreign policy. He says Hayden “frightens” him because we haven’t been able to defeat radical Islam because of the military’s weak  . He says we are losing because of people like Hayden. 8:37: Massive fundraising haul for Sanders: In a fundraising email, Team Sanders says it’s raised $3. 4m off over 115, 000 donations since polls closed in MI pic. twitter.   —   Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) March 10, 2016,  8:34: Trump, when asked if we are at war with Islam, says “I think Islam hates us. ” He says “there’s an unbelievable hatred of us” and says   need to figure out why. He say we can’t allow people to come into this country who have this hatred of the United States and people who aren’t Muslim. Trump says it’s hard to differentiate “radical Islam” from Islam because it’s hard to tell “who’s who  …    ” 8:30: At MSNBC’s town hall event, Rubio says getting rid of the   visa program would be like getting rid of handicapped placards because you saw some guy abuse it. He calls for reforms to prevent companies from abusing the system. Rubio says he promised the people of Florida that he would offer an Obama alternative re: his becoming the face of the Gang of Eight bill. Rubio doesn’t mention that he promised voters he would oppose amnesty. Moderator Chuck Todd doesn’t bring it up either. 8:25: On CNN, Trump says people in their sixties are telling him that they have never voted before but will vote for Trump. Trump says there is a massive number of Americans who do not vote and they may do so in this election because of his candidacy. 8:15: When asked if donors like Paul Singer influence him, Rubio says   donors are buying into his agenda and he is not buying into theirs. 8:07: Rubio says it shows how bad   are that he would even contemplate supporting Trump if he wins the nomination. Rubio says Trump will get destroyed in a general election. Rubio reluctantly says he won’t accept if Trump offers him the VP nod. Rubio dismisses a   unity ticket to derail Trump as “House of Cards stuff. ” 8:02: At MSNBC’s town hall with Chuck Todd, Rubio says he is the only one who can beat Trump in Florida and Trump can’t come away with all of the state’s delegates. Rubio whines that the media have given Trump a lot of air time. He blasts Trump for having made a lot of his products overseas. 7:47: Carson says he has no intention to run for Senate in Florida. He says he was asked to run in Maryland as well and turned people down. 7:46: On CNN, Carson says the debate tomorrow will be instructive when asked if he will endorse somebody. He says he hopes Trump talks more about his vision for America and does not get distracted by petty attacks, etc. Carson says Republicans have always found a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and we can’t let that happen this time. 7:42: Trump again says he is   his campaign. Now, he is genuinely amazed at a protester (“those are the most gentle protesters I’ve ever seen) who started to run out of the building when the “police went for her” and “the police never touched her. ” Trump jokes that the protester will sue the police tomorrow for “police brutality. ” This type of impromptu,    stuff from Trump makes his rallies interesting (not the petty    process stuff that he obsesses over). This is “Trump being Trump” and he shouldn’t change. It guarantees eyeballs on him. Trump’s jobs is to ensure that voters come away knowing what his message is, vision for the country is, and what he’ll fight   and not get that message muddled in all of the process stuff that nobody cares about. 7:40: In Breitbart News: The Great John Hayward on What Donald Trump Will Do to the Democrat. 7:37: Trump, in North Carolina: “We’re not gonna have a country left if we have Hillary. Can you imagine?” Trump reiterates that Clinton should not be allowed to run because of her email scandal. 7:36: Trump says “Little Marco” may be gone “but you never know. ” Trump calls Florida “my place” because he employs so many people there. He blasts Rubio for being “totally in favor of amnesty” and a “choke artist. ” 7:35: Trump says “I am a truthful person. Maybe truthful to a fault. ” He says Evangelicals aren’t voting for Lyin’ Ted because they don’t like liars. 7:33: GREAT JOB, GOP SMART SET: Rubio’s decision to completely upend his brand that he and his advisers had spent years cultivating to taunt Trump with juvenile attacks was “central to his unraveling. ” [Note: This was obvious a minute after he started his desperate attacks to anyone with a brain but the GOP Smart Set were   each other about how brilliant these attacks were. Great job, guys! Way to go!] Looking back, Rubio’s supporters see these fateful days as central to his unraveling. A strategy designed to get under Trump’s skin and force him on the defensive instead backfired on Rubio, diminishing the    senator who had spent years trying to demonstrate presidential gravitas. At rally after rally, Rubio was unintentionally personifying the caricature that Trump was perpetually drawing of him: “Little Marco. ” 7:25: Kasich: On trade, he says he doesn’t want trade deals that incentivize companies to move abroad. He says that in Dayton, a Chinese investor has created thousands of jobs so “it works both ways. ” 7:19: In North Carolina, Trump sees a “Hispanics for Trump” sign and points out he will do well with Hispanics. Trump blasts the media for saying that Trump reminded them of Hitler for playfully asking his audience to pledge to vote for him. Trump says that he even said he would not hold his supporters to the pledge. “Are these guys crazy?” Trump said. Trump said a liberal reporter told him today that “that was the most disgusting thing” he had ever seen. Trump says he does not want to ask his supporters to pledge to vote for him because he will get attacked. When the audience boooooos, Trump gives the pledge and says it was “done in fun. ” 7:17: Kasich says he supports Common Core because he wants “high standards” with local control. He says people hate it because people got “on the Internet” and “thought this was Washington dictating something. ” 7:10: Kasich understands Trump supporters who have been left behind in the economy who feel like they are losing their dignity when they can’t get hired after losing their jobs after factories shut down, etc. He talks about his   for retraining American workers. He also wants to move job training programs back to the states because one has to lose a job in order to get trained for another under the federal program. He also says vocational education programs should start in high school for those who want to learn various  . 7:04: Kasich says he will “probably” ask Jeb Bush to support him and he is looking forward to seeing Jeb. 7:02: On Fox News, Kasich says “it’s not even a question” when asked if he is going to win Ohio. 6:45: Meghan McCain: Carly Fiorina’s endorsement ‘swayed my opinion’ of Cruz: 6:13: Trump strong in Florida: #BREAKING Florida! #2016 #GOP @FoxNews #pollTrump 43 Rubio 20Cruz 16Kasich 10https:  .   —   Fox News Poll (@foxnewspoll) March 9, 2016,  6:10: Kasich leading in Fox News’s Ohio Poll: #BREAKING Ohio!  #2016 #GOP @FoxNews #pollKasich 34%Trump 29%Cruz 19%Rubio 7%https:  .   —   Fox News Poll (@foxnewspoll) March 9, 2016,  6:02: On MTP Daily, veteran Florida reporter Marc Caputo says a lot of   voters are telling him that they are voting for Trump in the primary. 6:00: Rubio introduces none other than Megyn Kelly at his rally: Megyn Kelly joins Rubio on stage  —   will be interviewing him shortly. pic. twitter.   —   Sean Sullivan (@WaPoSean) March 9, 2016,  Switching back to English, Rubio introduces @megynkelly on stage at his rally in Florida,  —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 9, 2016,  Fox News producer tells crowd to ”go crazy” for Rubio and @megynkelly when he waves his hands pic. twitter.   —   Anthony Zurcher (@awzurcher) March 9, 2016,  5:55: Rubio: ‘I will be on that ballot on Tuesday.’ WATCH: Speaking to hometown crowd, @MarcoRubio dismisses dropout rumors: ”I will be on that ballot on Tuesday” https:  .   —   ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) March 9, 2016,  5:50: Kasich now saying it’s   race (but says he isn’t disparaging Rubio): Kasich, on saying it’s a   race: ”I don’t mean to say anything to disparage Marco but what I will say is, it’s starting to turn our way”  —   Ben Gittleson (@bgittleson) March 9, 2016,  5:45: NASCAR facing criticism after some   endorsed Trump: #NASCAR and Brian France face criticism following Trump endorsement: https:  .   —   Jenna Fryer (@JennaFryer) March 9, 2016,  5:35: Not much enthusiasm at Rubio rally.

That’s the ultimate way of doing it,” Trump said. “You knock ’em out.

last week’s chemical attack as ”100% fabrication,” an assertion at odds with numerous eyewitness accounts, independent analysis and even the explanation given by its strongest ally, Russia. In an interview with the AFP news agency, conducted under restrictions imposed by the Syrian government at the presidential palace in Damascus, Assad claimed the reported details of what happened were not credible because their source was  ’s former affiliate in Syria, Nusra Front. He suggested that photographs showing children who had died in the attack on a   town in Idlib province, which provoked revulsion around the world, were staged. The entire incident was ”fabricated” and ”unconvincing,” Assad claimed.   RELATED: The images that moved the world, In fact, reports of what happened came from eyewitnesses, victims and medical staff. The day after the attack on April 4, which killed 89 people and injured dozens more, CNN interviewed victims who had fled over the border to Turkey. They recounted the horrific aftermath of a gas attack, saying the town of Khan Sheikhoun was struck by regime warplanes. Even Assad’s staunch ally, Russia, accepts that the deaths were caused by chemical weapons. Moscow offered the explanation that regime aircraft hit a chemical weapons facility controlled by rebels on the ground.  The UK Ministry of Defense and Turkish authorities say they have carried out tests on samples that provide evidence that Sarin or a similar substance was used. Experts have said that only the Syrian regime is likely to have the capability to produce Sarin, a volatile substance with a very short shelf life. Assad interview restricted, The interview with AFP’s Damascus bureau chief took place on Wednesday. Severe restrictions were placed on the news agency: it was not allowed to film the interview itself instead, the encounter was filmed by the Syrian presidency. Only footage of first five questions asked by the interviewer was provided to AFP. Syrian state news agency SANA later published what appeared to be the full transcript and video of the entire interview. Asked if he had ordered the chemical weapons attack, Assad said the Syrian military had no chemical weapons and that it would not use them if it did. ”We gave up our arsenal three years ago,” he said. ”We have never used our chemical arsenal in our history.” He added that ”morally” the Syrian government would never do this ”because it’s not acceptable.” In 2013, Syria was blamed for a chemical attack that hit the   Damascus suburb of Ghouta, in which activists say 1, 400 people died.  UN weapons inspectors returned ”overwhelming and indisputable” evidence of the use of nerve gas, although their mandate did not include assigning blame for the attack. Shortly after, under pressure from the West, Syria agreed to a Russian proposal to give up control of its chemical weapons. Assad ’fabrication’ claims  In his AFP interview, Assad accused the West, particularly the United States, of being ”   with the terrorists” over the Khan Sheikhoun incident. He claimed details of the attack were made up in order to give the US an excuse to bomb a Syrian airbase in retaliation. ”They fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack,” he said. This assertion is a departure even from the statement given by the Syrian army In the aftermath of the attack, which blamed ”terrorist groups” for the carnage. Neither did Russia deny the event occurred: Moscow claimed the deaths were the result of a regime airstrike on a chemical weapons stockpile on the ground, controlled by ”terrorists.”  Images of children foaming at the mouth shocked the world last week. Doctors at hospitals near the scene told CNN that victims had died of asphyxiation.  But Assad said it was possible to fake video and suggested the whole incident had been staged. ”We don’t know whether those dead children were killed in Khan Sheikhoun, were they dead at all?” he said. CNN and other international media interviewed victims of the attack who described how many of their relatives were killed. One man told how 25 members of his family had died, including his two young twins. He was pictured cradling their dead bodies. Assad calls for ’impartial investigation’ Assad said no proper investigation had been possible because the area was controlled by Nusra Front.  ”The only information the world have had till this moment is published by al Qaeda branch,” he said. ”  has any other information.” Assad said he would only allow an ”impartial” external investigation involving ”unbiased countries,” according to AFP. However, independent bodies are already investigating. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has said it is gathering evidence about the attack but cannot comment on an ongoing investigation. The World Health Organization said last week that some victims showed symptoms consistent with exposure to a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents.  That conclusion was supported by rights group Amnesty International, which said victims were ”very likely” to have been exposed to a compound such as Sarin. Russia, a close ally of Syria, on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution which sought to condemn the killings and call on the Assad regime to cooperate with an international investigation into the attack.', [('new', 4.07), ('presidential', 3.35), ('don', 2.3), ('years', 2.27), ('like', 2.14), ('know', 1.83), ('killed', 1.79), ('military', 1.67), ('government', 1.67), ('people', 1.65), ('terrorist', 1.61), ('world', 1.49), ('ms', 1.44), ('president', 1.42), ('going', 1.4), ('children', 1.34), ('family', 1.33), ('say', 1.31), ('ve', 1.29), ('life', 1.29), ('investigation', 1.22), ('countries', 1.19), ('ago', 1.17), ('did', 1.15), ('group', 1.1), ('year', 1.09), ('used', 1.06), ('including', 1.05), ('end', 1.05), ('war', 1.04), ('terror', 1.04), ('state', 1.01), ('authorities', 1.0), ('use', 0.99), ('death', 0.99), ('day', 0.98), ('attack', 0.98), ('groups', 0.96), ('media', 0.95), ('film', 0.94), ('later', 0.94), ('came', 0.93), ('terrorists', 0.9), ('car', 0.88), ('place', 0.87), ('young', 0.87), ('child', 0.85), ('took', 0.84), ('agency', 0.84), ('man', 0.83), ('killing', 0.83), ('rights', 0.81), ('question', 0.79), ('information', 0.79), ('history', 0.79), ('news', 0.78), ('area', 0.78), ('told', 0.77), ('medical', 0.74), ('ll', 0.73), ('statement', 0.73), ('near', 0.72), ('questions', 0.72), ('old', 0.71), ('asked', 0.71), ('fact', 0.71), ('plan', 0.71), ('according', 0.69), ('likely', 0.69), ('saying', 0.69), ('week', 0.68), ('members', 0.68), ('rate', 0.66), ('instead', 0.65), ('said', 0.65), ('chief', 0.65), ('close', 0.63), ('given', 0.62), ('particularly', 0.62), ('possible', 0.6), ('moment', 0.59), ('control', 0.59), ('able', 0.58), ('order', 0.56), ('evidence', 0.56), ('win', 0.55), ('try', 0.55), ('turn', 0.54), ('calls', 0.53), ('hospital', 0.53), ('member', 0.49), ('led', 0.48), ('moved', 0.48), ('border', 0.47), ('view', 0.46), ('story', 0.44), ('act', 0.42), ('result', 0.41), ('similar', 0.39), ('offered', 0.38), ('allowed', 0.36), ('entire', 0.35), ('eat', 0.34), ('era', 0.34), ('table', 0.32), ('independent', 0.25), ('suggest', 0.22), ('relative', 0.14)]), 3435: ('BETHESDA, Md.  —   The young surgeon was mystified. A   tumor had been removed from the stomach of his patient 12 years earlier, but his doctors had not been able to cut out many smaller growths in his liver. The cancer should have killed him, yet here he lay on the table for a routine gallbladder operation. The surgeon, Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, examined the man’s abdominal cavity, sifting his liver in his fingers, feeling for hard, dense tumors  —   but he could find no trace of cancer. It was 1968. Dr. Rosenberg had a hunch he had just witnessed an extraordinary case in which a patient’s immune system had vanquished cancer. Hoping there was an elixir in the man’s blood, Dr. Rosenberg got permission to transfuse some of it into a patient dying of stomach cancer. The effort failed. But it was the beginning of a lifelong quest. “Something began to burn in me,” he would write later, “something that has never gone out. ” Half a century later, Dr. Rosenberg, who turns 76 on Tuesday and is chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute here, is part of a small fraternity of researchers who have doggedly pursued a dream  —   turbocharging the body’s immune system so that more cancer patients can experience recoveries like his   patient’s. Dr. Rosenberg, Dr. Carl H. June of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Michel Sadelain of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have been at the forefront of this research for decades, laboring in separate labs in an intense     pursuit to bring to fruition a daring therapy that few colleagues believed would work. Now, versions of the therapy for a limited number of blood cancers are nearing approval by federal regulators, and could reach the market as early as next year. The technique, known as cell therapy, gives each patient an individualized and   version of their own immune system, one that “works better than nature made it,” as Dr. June puts it. The patient’s   the soldiers of the immune system, are extracted from the patient’s blood, then genetically engineered to recognize and destroy cancer. The redesigned cells are multiplied in the laboratory, and millions or billions of them are put back into the patient’s bloodstream, set loose like a vast army of tumor assassins. This is an unusual pharmaceutical  —   a drug that is alive and can multiply once inside the body. Dr. June calls these cells “serial killers. ” A single one can destroy up to 100, 000 cancer cells. The killer cells are genetically engineered to produce a complex protein, an amalgam of pieces from different parts of the immune system that is unlike anything seen before. “I call it a   molecule,” said Dr. Renier J. Brentjens, the director of cellular therapeutics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. This radical,   therapy differs sharply from the more established type of immunotherapy, developed by other researchers. Those    drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, release a molecular brake on the immune system, freeing it to fight the cancer much as it fights infections by bacteria or viruses. Cell therapy, in contrast, is brewed specially for each patient, one of the many challenges the field faces in broadening its use. So far, the number of patients treated with cell therapy is in the hundreds, not thousands. And for now it works only for certain types of blood cancers, not common malignancies like breast and lung cancer. Researchers are also still working out how to control potentially lethal side effects. Just recently, a clinical trial was briefly halted after three patients died of brain swelling. Still, cell therapy has produced complete remissions in some patients who were out of treatment options, stirring excitement among doctors and patients and setting off a race among companies to bring the treatments to market. Getting to this point has taken decades of painstaking work, with many false starts and setbacks. “It was conceivable we were pursuing a ghost,” Dr. Rosenberg recalled. The son of Orthodox Jews who immigrated from Poland to New York and ran luncheonettes, Steven Rosenberg was about 6 years old when his family learned that many relatives, including six of his father’s nine siblings, had been murdered in the Holocaust. “I saw so much evil in the world that early on I decided I wanted to do something that would help people, not hurt people,” he said in an interview here. He received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard. From the start, he was a workaholic. At one point he tried to call off his relationship with Alice O’Connell, whom he would later marry, because he was afraid it would distract him from research. “I loved the night,” Dr. Rosenberg wrote in his book, “The Transformed Cell,” published in 1992. “I remember the exhilaration of working through the night in the lab, drinking thick pasty coffee that had been on the burner for hours, walking out into the sunrise. ” He added: “To be alone and out on the edge like that, there was no feeling like it in the world. ” When Dr. Rosenberg arrived at the National Cancer Institute in 1974, his first attempt at immunotherapy was to give patients   harvested from pigs. That failed. He then began giving patients   or   a protein made by the body that spurs   to proliferate. In some cases he treated patients with their own white blood cells that had been incubated in  . The treatments sometimes set off such a violent immune system reaction that patients had to be placed in intensive care. From 1980 to 1984, he treated 66 patients without success. Then, in late 1984, he encountered patient No. 67, Linda Taylor, a Navy officer with melanoma whose personnel file carried the stamp “death imminent. ” Ms. Taylor is still alive her case and others catapulted Dr. Rosenberg and   onto the cover of Newsweek and the front pages of newspapers. Some of his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute began referring to him as Stevie Wonder, thinking he had developed a swelled head. But  ’s vaunted prowess fizzled, helping only a few percent of patients with melanoma or kidney cancer. Dr. Rosenberg then tried to surgically remove tumors and extract the   that had already penetrated them,     lymphocytes. He multiplied those cells in the lab and infused them back in the patient, along with shots of  . He limited his focus to melanoma, the skin cancer that seemed most susceptible to immune attack. The treatment eventually achieved remissions in about 10 percent to 25 percent of patients. But it was   and its application to other cancers unclear. There had to be a better way. Indeed, one approach was taking shape across the street from Dr. Rosenberg, at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda. The Navy was not Carl June’s desired career choice. Accepted at Stanford in 1971, he instead chose the Naval Academy to avoid the draft and Vietnam. The Navy sent him to medical school and for training in   transplantation, geared toward treating people irradiated by nuclear weapons. When the Cold War ended, the Navy lost interest. Dr. June turned to working with   at the Naval Medical Research Institute in the  . He and a colleague, Dr. Bruce Levine, found a way to multiply   in huge numbers outside the body, a method still used today. And in the   working with Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, Dr. June began trying to genetically modify patients’   to kill H. I. V. the virus that causes AIDS. But when his wife, Cindy, the mother of the couple’s three children, developed ovarian cancer in 1996, Dr. June’s research turned personal. Dr. June had tried everything to save her, including the primitive immune therapies under development. But Ms. June died in 2001. “A lot of other scientists would have been disillusioned by the failure, in his case the personal tragedy,” said Sean Parker, the internet billionaire who is funding some of Dr. June’s work. Instead, Dr. June, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, stopped treating patients, and devoted himself to creating cell therapies for cancer. “Things that were back burner on cell therapy became front burner,” he said. In the 1980s, scientists began experimenting with gene therapy, putting new genes into cells of the body to treat disease. Michel Sadelain, while still a graduate student studying immunology at the University of Alberta, told colleagues that he thought the technique could be used to supercharge   to fight cancer. “At the time it sounded very pipe dream,” said Douglas Green, who was one of Dr. Sadelain’s doctoral thesis advisers and is now chairman of immunology at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. But Dr. Sadelain, he continued, “believed in his approach and he pursued it relentlessly. ” After earning his Ph. D. Dr. Sadelain headed for the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass. to learn how to do gene therapy, using disabled viruses that could not cause disease to deliver genes into cells. By 1992, he had demonstrated that he could genetically engineer mouse  . He then moved to Sloan Kettering. In 2003, he and his colleagues  —   including his partner and now wife, Isabelle Rivière  —   showed that genetically engineered   could eradicate certain cancers in mice. How is this done? To fight cancer,   have to recognize cancerous cells. Each   in the body has unique receptors, sort of like claws that jut out from its surface.   patrol the body looking for protein fragments that indicate a cell might be infected by a bacterium or virus. If one of its claws latches on to such a fragment, the   destroys the cell displaying it. But cancer cells are mutated versions of the body’s own cells, not outsiders.   do not always recognize them as something to kill. So scientists like Dr. Sadelain decided to put a new claw on the   one that could recognize cancer by latching on to a telltale protein on cancer cells. The new claws came from another part of the immune system known as antibodies. Drug companies already knew how to make antibodies with claws that bind to specific proteins in the body. But the claw was not enough. Once a claw binds to a target protein, it needs a molecule to signal the   to go into killing mode. Yet another signal helps sustain the killing. The DNA instructions for all three components are inserted into the patient’s  . Since this concoction is part antibody and part   it is a chimera, like the monster of Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part serpent. The claw is called a receptor and the protein it binds to on the cancer cell, the target, is called an antigen. So the whole construct is called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and the use of it to treat cancer is called CAR   therapy, or  . Dr. Sadelain was not alone in this work. Zelig Eshhar, an Israeli scientist, is credited with developing one of the first crude CARs around 1989. Dr. Rosenberg, always on the lookout for new types of immunotherapy, invited Dr. Eshhar to be a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the National Cancer Institute. Another early developer was Dr. Dario Campana of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. As scientists worked to perfect the formula in the 1990s and early 2000s, there was quite a bit of sharing. Cancer cell therapy was still mostly an academic exercise it was highly uncertain whether it would ever really work. Dr. June, after hearing a presentation by Dr. Campana at a conference in 2003, requested a sample of Dr. Campana’s CAR. Dr. Sadelain shared his design with both Dr. June and Dr. Rosenberg. The most prominent CAR developed at the National Cancer Institute owes a lot to Dr. Sadelain, Dr. Rosenberg said. But the science proved difficult and the research money scarce. Pharmaceutical companies showed little interest, preferring   drugs, one size fits all, rather than a treatment that would be made separately for each patient. Again, a death from cancer propelled the field forward. In 2001, a    woman, Kimberly Lawrence Netter, succumbed to breast cancer. Her    Edward Netter, a wealthy financial services entrepreneur, and his wife, Barbara, formed the nonprofit Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy, which issued some of its first grants to Dr. June and Dr. Sadelain. Dr. June also got support from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. “Without that,” Dr. June said of the charities, “we would not have had a clinical trial. ” As the first decade of this century neared its end, the three pioneers were ready for the big moment  —   testing their treatments in patients. They scrambled to be the first to announce   results. Dr. Rosenberg and colleagues published first, in the journal Blood in 2010. They described a single patient with lymphoma whose tumors shrank after treatment. (The patient later received more therapy, and has been free of cancer since.) But the approach really attracted attention the next year when Dr. June reported that two of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia went into complete remission. One of them, Doug Olson, a chemist from Tinicum Township, Pa. left the hospital and immediately bought a sailboat. He also took to running  . “It was like this weight that had been sitting there was gone,” said Mr. Olson, who is free of cancer nearly six years later. Bill Ludwig, a retired captain in the New Jersey Department of Corrections, had already paid for his funeral when he started treatment in August 2010. Once his genetically engineered   were unleashed in his system, Mr. Ludwig’s lungs started to fail, his legs ballooned to twice their size, his blood pressure dropped and he began hallucinating. When he emerged from the ordeal, doctors searched for cancer. Detecting none, they ordered another test, certain of error. But there was no mistake. Five pounds of tumor had been destroyed. Mr. Ludwig, now 71, and his wife bought an R. V. “We’re trying to make up for lost time,” he said. He has celebrated the high school graduations of five grandchildren and welcomed his first  . As for Dr. June, Mr. Ludwig said: “It’s hard to describe someone who basically saved your life. He lost the one he loved, and turned around and saved me years later. ” The 2011 publication of Dr. June’s results transformed the field. Novartis, the big Swiss pharmaceutical company, licensed the rights to the therapies created in Dr. June’s lab at the University of Pennsylvania, throwing aside concerns that treatments manufactured for individual patients would not be good business. That set off a commercial rush, flooding the field with cash after years of doubt. While various companies are in pursuit, three are in the lead. They hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to bring the first CAR treatments to market as early as 2017 or 2018, although it is not yet clear how easy it will be to get regulatory approval for such a novel therapy. The companies are teamed with academic pioneers: Novartis with Penn Kite Pharma with the National Cancer Institute and Juno Therapeutics with Sloan Kettering, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Seattle Children’s Hospital. Somewhat predictably, success provoked jostling and envy. Rather than being allies against a disbelieving world, the pioneers now had something worth fighting over  —   credit, and the gleam of a possible Nobel Prize. While the Sloan Kettering researchers had done some of the early genetic engineering, they did not publish strong results in five patients until 2013. By then, they had been scooped by Dr. Rosenberg with one patient and Dr. June with three. The spotlight further shifted to Dr. June because of his success with Emily Whitehead, a little girl whose miraculous recovery in 2012 made her the poster child for cell therapy. When Mr. Parker, the internet entrepreneur, announced in April that he would spend $250 million to start a new cancer immunotherapy institute, Emily, now 11, appeared on stage at the launch extravaganza with Lady Gaga. Dr. June’s 2011 publications did not cite Dr. Rosenberg’s paper from the previous year, prompting Dr. Rosenberg to write a letter to The New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. June’s publications also did not acknowledge that the genetic construct he had used was the one he had obtained from Dr. Campana of St. Jude. St. Jude sued the University of Pennsylvania. Novartis sided with Penn, and Juno Therapeutics with St. Jude. The suit was settled last year, with Novartis agreeing to pay $12. 25 million plus possible future payments and royalties. Within days, Dr. June sent a correction and letter of regret to The New England Journal of Medicine, acknowledging that the CAR used in his groundbreaking 2011 study, and in treating Emily Whitehead, was “designed, developed and provided” by St. Jude. Patrick M. Coughlin, who teaches anatomy at the Commonwealth Medical College in Scranton, Pa. now explains the immune system to his classes by telling how one man overcame cancer. Only gradually does it become clear that he is referring to himself. Now 63, Mr. Coughlin noticed a mass the size of a softball in his abdomen in summer 2013. It was a form of  ’s lymphoma. Three different types of chemotherapy and a   transplant all failed to help him. Desperate, he came to the National Institutes of Health campus here last year for the cell therapy developed by Dr. Rosenberg’s team. The battle between Mr. Coughlin’s genetically engineered immune cells and the cancer was brutal. For four days he had a fever as high as 105, chills and   sweats. Even his brain malfunctioned  —   at one point he could not count to 10 or write his wife’s name. But when the battle ended, the cancer was no longer there. “If I had gotten this thing five years ago,” he said of his disease, “I’d be dead. ” Yet for all the excitement, there are reasons for caution. The CAR therapy works now only for patients with some   lymphomas and leukemias, which account for only about 80, 000 of the 1. 7 million cases of cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. It has not been successfully used to treat malignancies of the lungs, breast, prostate, colon or other organs. “The solid tumors that kill over 90 percent of people do not respond to anything we have now,” Dr. Rosenberg said. Because it is personalized, cell therapy is likely to be frightfully expensive  —   probably hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, though the companies bringing these treatments to market have not yet said how much they would charge. Producing the   cells is lengthy and complex. Some patients have died during the two to four weeks it took to genetically modify and multiply their cells. And the therapy itself can be arduous. First, patients get chemotherapy to wipe out many of their existing   to make room for the engineered ones. Once those enter the body, they can set off a ferocious immune response as well as temporary neurological problems like memory loss, seizures and hallucinations. Recently Juno Therapeutics had to temporarily halt its clinical trial after three patients died from brain swelling. The problem arose when the company added a second chemotherapy drug to the regimen preparing the patients for the cell infusion. The authorities allowed the trial to resume without that chemotherapy drug. Still, some patients find themselves hoping they get violently ill, since that is a sign the treatment is working. “Every morning my wife would ask me how I’m feeling,” said Myles Stiefvater, a copier salesman from Newark, Del. who had the treatment in 2014. When he said he felt O. K. they were disappointed. Researchers are also finding, to their dismay, that remissions do not always last. The therapy has had its biggest success in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, producing complete remissions for 60 percent to more than 90 percent of patients. Yet up to half of those patients eventually suffer a relapse. In some cases, the tumor evolves so that it no longer displays on its surface what the claw binds to, making it invisible to the engineered cells. In other cases, the engineered cells might not last long enough in the body, giving the cancer a chance to resurge. Karen Shollenberger, a student at Drexel University with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, thought she was in the clear after being in remission for nine months after a   treatment. But in September, as the school year was beginning, the cancer returned. “My high hopes for the rest of the term were crushed,” Ms. Shollenberger wrote on her blog in October. She entered a new trial testing a new CAR therapy directed at another protein on  . Again the cancer went into remission, and she returned to school. But fear lurked in her: What if the new therapy also stopped working? That indeed happened recently. Her best hope now is a   transplant. “Each relapse is increasingly terrifying as the options continue to shrink,” said Ms. Shollenberger, 22. But, she said, the cell therapies have given her nearly two good years. The big thrust now is to expand the use of cell therapy to additional types of cancer. The key is to find protein targets that the engineered   can latch on to to kill cancer cells. Ideally, such a protein should be on all the tumor cells, so the entire cancer would be eradicated. But it should not be on healthy cells, or they would also be destroyed, causing side effects. “  are very powerful,” said Dr. Campana, formerly of St. Jude and now at the National University of Singapore. “In the same way they can eliminate cancer, they can also kill you. ” A protein called HER2, for instance, is found on many breast and other tumors, making it a seemingly good target. But it is also found in tiny amounts in the lungs. When Dr. Rosenberg’s team infused killer   aimed at HER2 into a patient, she went into respiratory distress within 15 minutes and died five days later. The treatments work for the blood cancers because there is a good target. But finding these for the most common cancers has been difficult. One problem is that CARs, because of how they are made, can bind only to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. But most proteins made by these cells, or by any cell for that matter, are inside the cell, out of reach. There is an alternative approach that is gaining interest. Patients’ immune cells can be engineered to make what are called   receptors, or TCRs. These can recognize proteins inside the cancer cells. Some experts say TCRs, which have a far wider array of potential targets, represent the best hope of using cell therapy to treat solid tumors. There have been hints of effectiveness already in treating one of those, a type of sarcoma. It might turn out that the best target for each patient will be unique to that person. Scientists are now experimenting with using DNA sequencing and other techniques to find the best mutated protein in each person’s tumor at which to aim the claw. “Think of how dauntingly personalized this is,” Dr. Rosenberg said. “We are using their own cells to treat a unique mutation in their own tumor. ” He said this approach might allow cell therapy to be used for most patients. Many other improvements are on the runway. Dr. Sadelain and Juno are working on “armored CARs” that not only bind to the target but produce   chemicals. Cellectis, a French company, has treated two babies with an    CAR treatment that does not require each patient’s cells to be processed. Bellicum Pharmaceuticals is working on genetic switches that dim or shut off the CAR if the treatment is endangering the patient. “We’re in the Model T version of the CAR now,” said Dr. Levine, now the director of the cell production facility at the University of Pennsylvania. “What’s coming along are Google CARs and Tesla CARs. ” In February, the   Center for Advanced Cellular Therapeutics opened on the ninth floor of a Penn medical building, paid for mainly by $20 million from Novartis. It has gleaming new laboratory space, clean rooms with the capacity to manufacture therapy for 400 patients a year, and a great view of downtown Philadelphia. On the wall are photographs of patients with success stories, like Doug Olson running a   and, of course, Emily Whitehead. Dr. June, who remarried and had two more children, now jets off regularly to attend conferences and give talks. A world map hanging outside his office is titled “Where in the World Is Carl June?” It has pins stuck in every location he has been, and a picture of him on a bicycle pinned to his location at the moment. In the last two years he has visited more than 150 cities in more than 20 countries. This year alone he has accumulated more than 200, 000 airline miles. Despite that schedule, he runs ultramarathons and participated in July in the Death Ride, a grueling bicycle race in California. Dr. Rosenberg still arrives at the National Cancer Institute nearly seven days a week. The walls outside his office are covered with signed photographs of the hundreds of fellows who have trained under him, many of them now leaders in immunotherapy. Every five years, they gather for a reunion, to reminisce and honor their mentor. Arie Belldegrun, who was a fellow in the 1980s, now runs Kite, the company commercializing the National Cancer Institute’s CAR technology. He recounted what happened when he tried to get Dr. Rosenberg to join the company. “He sits quietly, quietly, quietly, and then he asks, ‘Arie, why don’t you ask me what I want to do?’ “He said: ‘Every day that I go to work, I’m as excited as a kid coming to a new place for the first time. If you ask me what I want to do, I want to die on this desk one day. ’” But not before he conquers cancer. “I want to end this holocaust,” Dr. Rosenberg said in the interview. “I think I’m finally getting the hang of what it will take to widely apply this to cancers. ”', [('new', 2.23), ('don', 1.26), ('years', 1.24), ('company', 1.17), ('like', 1.17), ('time', 1.02), ('just', 1.02), ('think', 1.01), ('know', 1.0), ('killed', 0.98), ('people', 0.9), ('really', 0.85), ('want', 0.84), ('long', 0.83), ('make', 0.82), ('world', 0.82), ('way', 0.81), ('law', 0.8), ('ms', 0.79), ('vote', 0.74), ('children', 0.73), ('family', 0.73), ('good', 0.72), ('say', 0.72), ('companies', 0.71), ('ve', 0.71), ('life', 0.71), ('times', 0.69), ('public', 0.66), ('mother', 0.65), ('countries', 0.65), ('money', 0.65), ('come', 0.64), ('ago', 0.64), ('did', 0.63), ('lot', 0.61), ('federal', 0.61), ('year', 0.6), ('got', 0.59), ('little', 0.58), ('used', 0.58), ('including', 0.58), ('end', 0.58), ('need', 0.57), ('point', 0.57), ('war', 0.57), ('power', 0.57), ('called', 0.56), ('percent', 0.56), ('state', 0.55), ('better', 0.55), ('work', 0.55), ('left', 0.55), ('case', 0.55), ('business', 0.55), ('authorities', 0.55), ('does', 0.54), ('use', 0.54), ('death', 0.54), ('billion', 0.53), ('day', 0.53), ('attack', 0.53), ('help', 0.53), ('financial', 0.52), ('media', 0.52), ('later', 0.51), ('father', 0.51), ('came', 0.51), ('nations', 0.51), ('leaders', 0.5), ('market', 0.49), ('night', 0.49), ('big', 0.49), ('far', 0.49), ('million', 0.48), ('car', 0.48), ('place', 0.48), ('young', 0.47), ('child', 0.46), ('early', 0.46), ('took', 0.46), ('man', 0.46), ('killing', 0.45), ('school', 0.45), ('best', 0.45), ('rights', 0.45), ('making', 0.44), ('months', 0.44), ('pay', 0.43), ('news', 0.43), ('set', 0.42), ('different', 0.42), ('told', 0.42), ('great', 0.42), ('decades', 0.41), ('office', 0.41), ('thought', 0.41), ('medical', 0.4), ('nearly', 0.4), ('went', 0.4), ('ll', 0.4), ('technology', 0.4), ('near', 0.39), ('white', 0.39), ('issue', 0.39), ('old', 0.39), ('research', 0.39), ('clear', 0.39), ('fact', 0.39), ('plan', 0.39), ('past', 0.38), ('high', 0.38), ('star', 0.38), ('director', 0.38), ('dollars', 0.38), ('half', 0.38), ('outside', 0.38), ('likely', 0.38), ('days', 0.38), ('began', 0.37), ('known', 0.37), ('week', 0.37), ('growth', 0.37), ('miles', 0.37), ('future', 0.37), ('line', 0.37), ('small', 0.37), ('rate', 0.36), ('thousands', 0.36), ('instead', 0.36), ('said', 0.35), ('chief', 0.35), ('face', 0.35), ('open', 0.35), ('health', 0.35), ('using', 0.35), ('building', 0.34), ('recent', 0.34), ('recently', 0.34), ('love', 0.34), ('given', 0.34), ('trying', 0.34), ('tech', 0.33), ('effort', 0.33), ('possible', 0.33), ('seen', 0.33), ('today', 0.32), ('working', 0.32), ('moment', 0.32), ('control', 0.32), ('study', 0.32), ('able', 0.32), ('weeks', 0.31), ('sales', 0.31), ('worked', 0.31), ('team', 0.31), ('order', 0.31), ('science', 0.3), ('win', 0.3), ('felt', 0.3), ('try', 0.3), ('matter', 0.3), ('ways', 0.3), ('number', 0.3), ('powerful', 0.3), ('taking', 0.3), ('scientists', 0.29), ('turn', 0.29), ('believe', 0.29), ('head', 0.29), ('experience', 0.29), ('calls', 0.29), ('hospital', 0.29), ('process', 0.28), ('numbers', 0.28), ('hours', 0.28), ('play', 0.28), ('career', 0.28), ('approach', 0.28), ('sea', 0.28), ('member', 0.27), ('researchers', 0.27), ('received', 0.27), ('led', 0.26), ('moved', 0.26), ('hope', 0.26), ('taken', 0.26), ('lost', 0.26), ('wrote', 0.26), ('reason', 0.25), ('adviser', 0.25), ('view', 0.25), ('lead', 0.25), ('longer', 0.25), ('development', 0.24), ('free', 0.24), ('create', 0.24), ('student', 0.24), ('increasingly', 0.24), ('problems', 0.23), ('main', 0.23), ('personal', 0.23), ('act', 0.23), ('potential', 0.23), ('works', 0.22), ('relationship', 0.22), ('result', 0.22), ('space', 0.22), ('book', 0.22), ('signed', 0.21), ('summer', 0.2), ('allowed', 0.2), ('attention', 0.19), ('entire', 0.19), ('eat', 0.19), ('era', 0.18), ('table', 0.17), ('seven', 0.17), ('battle', 0.17), ('aside', 0.13), ('fellow', 0.12), ('colleagues', 0.12), ('bringing', 0.11), ('save', 0.11), ('covered', 0.1), ('relative', 0.08), ('demonstrated', 0.07)]), 33963: (' (CNN) A shooting at a crowded Arizona restaurant left two men dead in an altercation Friday night involving three people who knew one another, authorities said.  The shooting was contained to the Firebirds Wood Fired Grill restaurant in the La Encantada mall in Tucson, said Pima County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Cody Gress. One woman was injured with a gunshot to the leg and was treated at a local hospital, Gress said. On Saturday, the sheriff’s department described the shooting as an apparent  . The shooting suspect was identified as Frederick Bair, 60, who died of a   gunshot wound, the department said. He was a captain with the Tucson Fire Department, the agency’s spokesman said in a news release. Bair’s   Mary Jo Bair, was wounded. And a male victim,    Eliot Cobb, died. ”It looked like two gentlemen were fighting, it was hard to tell,” witness Laura Harder told CNN affiliate   in Tucson. ”I saw a gun come out and he just shot him in the head right in front of us.” Harder said the restaurant was full when she noticed something was happening at a nearby table. After the shooting, she saw how the gunman grabbed the other man’s companion by the arm and pushed her down a hallway. Harder heard two more gunshots while crawling on the ground for an exit. ”I assumed he had shot her,” she said. As gunshots erupted, patrons began screaming and running out of the restaurant.   Toni Esquibel was celebrating her daughter’s 13th birthday with family and friends. They had just been served their meals when the commotion began and they took cover under their table.  ”There were probably about 10 shots. It was pretty harrowing.

Her price has reached $12, 500 and she will be sold soon. ”[The posting in Arabic appeared on an encrypted conversation along with ads for kittens, weapons and tactical gear. It was shared with the Associated Press by an activist with the minority Yazidi community, whose women and children are being held as sex slaves by the extremists.  While the Islamic State group is losing territory in its   caliphate, it is tightening its grip on the estimated 3, 000 women and girls held as sex slaves. In a fusion of ancient barbaric practices and modern technology, IS sells the women like chattel on smartphone apps and shares databases that contain their photographs and the names of their “owners” to prevent their escape through IS checkpoints. The fighters are assassinating smugglers who rescue the captives, just as funds to buy the women out of slavery are drying up. The thousands of Yazidi women and children were taken prisoner in August 2014, when IS fighters overran their villages in northern Iraq with the aim to eliminate the   minority because of its ancient faith. Since then, Arab and Kurdish smugglers managed to free an average of 134 people a month. But by May, an IS crackdown reduced those numbers to just 39 in the last six weeks, according to figures provided by the Kurdistan regional government. Mirza Danai, founder of the   aid organization Luftbrucke Irak, said in the last two or three months, escape has become more difficult and dangerous. “They register every slave, every person under their owner, and therefore if she escapes, every Daesh control or checkpoint, or security force  —   they know that this girl   …     has escaped from this owner,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for the group. The AP has obtained a batch of 48 head shots of the captives, smuggled out of the   region by an escapee, which people familiar with them say are similar to those in the extremists’ slave database and the smartphone apps. Lamiya Aji Bashar tried to flee four times before finally escaping in March, racing to   territory with Islamic State group fighters in pursuit. A land mine exploded, killing her companions,    Almas and Katherine, 20. She never learned their last names. The explosion left Lamiya blind in her right eye, her face scarred by melted skin. Saved by the man who smuggled her out, she counts herself among the lucky. “I managed in the end, thanks to God, I managed to get away from those infidels,” the    the AP from a bed at her uncle’s home in the northern Iraqi town of Baadre. “Even if I had lost both eyes, it would have been worth it, because I have survived them. ” *** The Sunni extremists view the Yazidis as barely human. The Yazidi faith combines elements of Islam, Christianity and Zoroastrianism, an ancient Persian religion. Their   population in Iraq was estimated around 500, 000. Their number today is unknown. Nadia Mourad, an escapee, has appeared before the US Congress and the European Parliament to appeal for international help. “Daesh is proud of what it’s done to the Yazidis,” she said to Parliament. “They are being used as human shields. They are not allowed to escape or flee. Probably they will be assassinated. Where is the world in all this? Where is humanity?” IS relies on encrypted apps to sell the women and girls, according to an activist who is documenting the transactions and asked not to be named for fear of his safety. The activist showed AP the negotiations for the captives in encrypted conversations as they were occurring in real time. The postings appear primarily on Telegram and on Facebook and WhatsApp to a lesser degree, he said. Both   WhatsApp and Telegram use    encryption to protect users’ privacy. Both have said they consider protecting private conversations and data paramount, and that they themselves cannot access users’ content. “Telegram is extremely popular in the Middle East, among other regions,” said Telegram spokesman Markus Ra. “This, unfortunately, includes the more marginal elements and the broadest   masses alike. ” He added the company is committed to prevent abuse of the service and that it routinely removes public channels used by IS. In addition to the posting for the    in a group with hundreds of members, the AP viewed an ad on WhatsApp for a mother with a    and a    baby, with a price of $3, 700. “She wants her owner to sell her,” read the posting, followed by a photo. “We have zero tolerance for this type of behavior and disable accounts when provided with evidence of activity that violates our terms. We encourage people to use our reporting tools if they encounter this type of behavior,” said Matt Steinfeld, a spokesman for WhatsApp. Like the Bible, some passages of the Quran implicitly condone slavery, which was widespread when the holy book emerged. It also allows men to have sex with both their wives and “those they possess with their right hands,” taken by interpreters to refer to female slaves. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, most Muslim scholars backed the banning of slavery, citing Quranic verses that say freeing them is a blessing. Some   however, continued to insist that under Shariah, sex slavery must be permitted, though the Islamic State group is the first in the modern era to bring it into organized practice. In the images obtained by AP, many of the women and girls are dressed in finery, some in heavy makeup. All look directly at the camera, standing in front of overstuffed chairs or brocade curtains in what resembles a shabby hotel ballroom. Some are barely out of elementary school. Not one looks older than 30. One of them is Nazdar Murat, who was about 16 when she was abducted two years ago  —   one of more than two dozen young women taken away by the extremists in a single day in August 2014. Her father and uncles were among about 40 people killed when IS took over the Sinjar area, the heart of the Yazidi homeland. Inside an immaculately kept tent in a displaced persons camp outside the northern Iraqi town of Dahuk, Nazdar’s mother said her daughter managed to call once, six months ago. “We spoke for a few seconds. She said she was in Mosul,” said Murat, referring to Iraq’s   city. “Every time someone comes back, we ask them what happened to her and no one recognizes her. Some people told me she committed suicide. ” The family keeps the file of missing Yazidis on a mobile phone. They show it to those who have escaped the caliphate, to find out if anyone has seen her, and to other families looking for a thread of hope they’ll see their own missing relatives again. The odds of rescue, however, grow slimmer by the day. The smuggling networks that have freed the captives are being targeted by IS leaders, who are fighting to keep the Yazidis at nearly any cost, said Andrew Slater of the nonprofit group Yazda, which helps document crimes against the community and organizes refuge for those who have fled. Kurdistan’s regional government had been reimbursing impoverished Yazidi families who paid up to $15, 000 in fees to smugglers to rescue their relatives, or the ransoms demanded by individual fighters to give up the captives. But the Kurdish regional government no longer has the funds. For the past year, Kurdistan has been mired in an economic crisis brought on by the collapse of oil prices, a dispute with Iraq’s central government over revenues, and the fallout from the war against the Islamic State. Even when IS retreats from towns like Ramadi or Fallujah, the missing girls are nowhere to be found. “Rescues are slowing. They’re going to stop. People are running out of money, I have dozens of families who are tens of thousands of dollars in debt,” Slater said. “There are still thousands of women and kids in captivity but it’s getting harder and harder to get them out. ” *** Lamiya was abducted from the village of Kocho, near the town of Sinjar, in the summer of 2014. Her parents are presumed dead. Somewhere, she said, her    sister Mayada remains captive. One photo she managed to send to the family shows the little girl standing in front of an IS flag. Five other sisters all managed to escape and later were relocated to Germany. A younger brother, kept for months in an IS training camp in Mosul, also slipped away and is now staying with other relatives in Dahuk, a city in the Iraqi Kurdish region. Sitting very still and speaking in a monotone, Lamiya recounted her captivity, describing how she was passed from one IS follower to another, all of whom beat and violated her. She was determined to escape. She said her first “owner” was an Iraqi IS commander who went by the name Abu Mansour in the city of Raqqa, the   IS capital deep in Syria. He brutalized her, often keeping her handcuffed. She tried to run away twice but was caught, beaten and raped repeatedly. After a month, she said, she was sold to another IS extremist in Mosul. After she spent two months with him, she was sold again, this time to an IS   who Lamiya said forced her to help him make suicide vests and car bombs. “I tried to escape from him,” she said. “And he captured me, too, and he beat me. ” When the   grew bored with her, she was handed over to an IS doctor in Hawija, a small   Iraqi town. She said the doctor, who was the IS head of the town hospital, also abused her. From there, after more than a year, she managed to contact her relatives in secret. Her uncle said the family paid local smugglers $800 to arrange Lamiya’s escape.

The cartel made the offer on various social media platforms as cartel gunmen unleashed another wave of violence in this city. [On Friday afternoon, rival factions of the Gulf Cartel clashed in the streets of this city unleashing a barrage of machine gun fire and grenade explosions that spread terror. The intensity of the fighting led to the city government issuing a red alert notice on social media. Officials pushed out the social media notification as a way to warn citizens to stay indoors because of battles spreading throughout the city.   Rival factions of the Gulf Cartel began a bloody war for control of this border city on Tuesday, Breitbart Texas reported. The fighting follows the demise of former regional cartel boss Juan Manuel “Comandante Toro  ” Loiza Salinas. Since then, various commanders loyal to him have been fighting the rest of the cartel in an effort to stop them from taking over the city.  On Friday afternoon, the Gulf Cartel disseminated a video where they offered a reward of up to $500, 000 for one of the commanders loyal to the late Toro. The video also offered descending amounts for other key commanders. In the video, the masked gunman claims that the Gulf Cartel does not kidnap or extort innocent civilians like the faction loyal to El Toro. He claimed their only interest is in trafficking drugs, not violent crime.  The Tamaulipas government confirmed that 14 people died in the clashes since Tuesday night. Local residents claim the body count is actually 19 individuals killed including innocent bystanders and several others injured.  According to government officials on Friday afternoon, the rival factions clashed and also attacked Mexican authorities on two separate occasions. The fighting led to two gunmen dying and two individuals being injured.  The fighting has led to an increase in carjackings as cartel gunmen continue to use SUVs in order to load up teams on gunmen for their battles. Authorities have recovered more than a dozen vehicles that cartel gunmen have left behind. Cartel members spray painted some of those vehicles with the call sign   pointing to that faction being loyal to El Toro. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
