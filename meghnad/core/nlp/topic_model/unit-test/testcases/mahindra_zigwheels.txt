On the eve of India's 75th independence day, mahindra declared war on every other car maker in the country. Everything from hatchbacks to large SUVs, and everything in between with the announcement of this, the SUV seven double, which partly replaces the XUV five double. But the key little piece of information that came out was the price tags, starting at twelve lakh rupees for the base variant, with the 200 HP petrol engine going up to 15 lakhs for the second from top ex five variant, which is crazy. So basically, price is a very key weapon in the XUV seveno's arsenal to win over the Indian market. But it needs to have a few more key weapons. What are those? Presidents. Now, as the name suggests, the 700 is a step up over the 500. And in that regard, to give it more presence, it is bigger, it is longer. So it's a sizable car. And this change in proportion just makes the lines flow better. It looks more mature, the lines are softer and cleaner. So it may not look as striking as the SUV five double o, but it is big enough to look confidently straight at its rivals. And the overall design, in terms of the details, you see, there's no one element shouting for attention. And because of that, it just looks better. It looks more memorable and likable. While this is all new, especially the grill and the logo sitting right there, there is that XUV DNA that's calling out to you. For instance, these dual c shaped Led DRLs. These are an evolution of the design we've seen on the XUV five double. And of course, being an XUV, it packs in a lot like the swipe style turn indicators and of course, full Led headlamps, led fog lamps and cornering lamps as well. So you've got something that's packed and distincted. The real party piece on the XV seven double or, which you would want to show and talk about, is here what I call as anand door handles. Well, I'll explain why. These are those pop out, flush fitting door handles. And apparently they came about because when Anand Mahindra went to look at the XUV seven double in his development phase, he saw the design and said, don't spoil it by putting door handles. Keep the look nice and clean. Now, interestingly, there are two variants of these pop up door handles. The one we've got here is the simple mechanical kind, which just pops out when you use it. It retracts right back in. And then there's a motorized kind, which pops out when you unlock the car and then goes back in when you lock it. If you ask me personally, I prefer the simple mechanical version. It's simpler and it works just fine. This is another great angle from which to soak in that XUV DNA, because if you look at the wheel arches, the way they flare out, if you look at the window line, the way it kinks up past the B pillar, this is all typical SUV. The rear, it's better too. Not its best angle, but certainly looks more appetizing. Now, these tail amps can look a little too sharp, but on the move they do the job. They light up beautifully and give it a premium look. This bid here is the one bit that I'm not a fan of and to me, this seems like a bit of an afterthought to accommodate the new logo that Mahindra came up with after Pratabo joined recently. And this has just been done to accommodate that. Interestingly, the tailgate is entirely made of plastic to accommodate these sharp lines. And of course, that is going to help save weight on a car that is much bigger. That is important and interestingly. The XV Seven double O is lighter by 160. Weapon is the inside story, starting with the boot. Now, you have enough space here on offer for small overnighters, even with all three rows in uses. And if you need more luggage, of course you can drop one of these seats down to pack in more. But if you really have a priority for luggage, you can offer the five seater variants, which will most likely be offered on the lower two variants, versus the seven seater will be the higher variance. Well, as you can see, this isn't really bad, even for somebody like me, who is 5ft six inches short. So if you want to accommodate kids here, it's going to be pretty easy. And you've got enough foot room here to sit comfortably. Actually, the underpass support, as can be expected from third row, is not all that great. But you've got great glass area here, so the view out is nice. You've got equivalents on both sides, blow controls, you've got one charging socket at the rear here. No USB ports, but you do have cup holders on both sides. Now, this doesn't look like much, but there is enough near one of them. So if I had to spend time here, I could do an hour or so without complaining. The inside story a strong point with this kind of nero. Well, that's if the front seat is pushed all the way back, if you push it forward, well, you could do this. But realistically, even with a taller passenger in the front, you can get plenty of knee room. And again, there's foot room to stretch out. The basics are right. The window lines, low, good glass area, so it feels like an airy cabin, so you can spend time here for longer distances. And with these supportive seats, it is a comfy place to be. The flat floor and the wide cabin made the SUV comfy for five or seven people, so families will love it. But if you're the one who's going to drive, the front seat experience is welcoming. Look at that park seat sliding back to welcome you inside. And this is a great place to be again from the basic standpoint, because your view out is good. You've got a great view of the ORVMs and back there. And for a vehicle that's big as this, it's important. It makes you feel more comfortable. Seats supported. And if you look at this cabin, it's such a mature looking cabin, nothing feels overdone. In fact, the materials that you can see here, soft touch finish here, really nicely down the stitches. Now this may be hard plastic here, but it all looks like quality stuff. And don't miss this cool little wood finish here, which gives it that richer feel. And of course, the switches for your powered seat right here. So the front seat experience in the SUV Seven double O certainly is a big step forward. Simple. With the basics hitting the spot, the SUV will treat you well in every row. Weapon three the features list. Now, I'm not just saying it because it's long, it's because it's really well spread out. If you look at the base Mxperience, that gets an eight inch touch screen system and a seven inch digital display for the driver, that's the base. And then if you step up to the Ax Three, you get a few more goodies like this. The Adreno X system with the 210.25 inch displays, which are super crisp. And if you step up to the Ax Five, that's where you get curtain airbags, which stretch all the way back to the third row. This is a feature paka. And if you look at the details like this entertainment, it works really well. It's really crisp. Right now we couldn't control the Android Auto, but we've been told that these are the development prototypes. So things are still being smoothed out. But there are some really interesting details. Like there's a DVR feature which allows you to capture the feed from all the cameras, kind of like a dash cam. And there's a laptop recorder. So nifty little details that Mandarin is still not talking about. And finally, if you have to talk about the Ax Seven, that's where you get all the bells and whistles, like the dual zone climate control, the powered seat. And if you're wondering about the Sony Twelve speaker sound system and the wireless charger, well, those are going to be part of a tech pack. Letters at the end of the badges indicate the packs luxury and tech. We think the pack that we want is the one with the Sony sound system because it's fantastic. So what else does the Ax Seven, the top N variant, offer you? Weapon Four safety. Well, that's because the XUV Seven double O doesn't just want to keep you safe when you're in an accident, it wants to help you avoid an accident altogether. And that's where the top end variant comes in because that's packing segment first. Radar based adapt technology. Basically, you've got features like Lane Keep Assist, which actually steals the car for you to keep you in your lane. It's got lane departure warning, it's got auto emergency braking, which means you can avoid collision. And then when you start driving the XUV Seven double O, you realize that the ad set actually works in Indian conditions. So, like when you don't have proper lane markings, it still senses the edge of the road and steers you in the right direction. So it feels helpful, not annoying. And then you have adaptive cruise control, which understands that distance between cars in Indian conditions is typically lesser than in other countries, and it adapts accordingly. And then you have auto emergency braking, which in the chaos of Indian roads, keeps a calm head. So this is tech that seems, on the basis of our first interaction here, to work in our conditions, and it's properly helpful. Now, this is going to be offered with the manual transmission options and the automatic with the automatic footpost getting a greater degree of control and helpfulness. And of course, electronic safety AIDS include ESC and all the addons with it, like hill, hole, secondary collision, mitigation. And well, in terms of airbags, you get seven on the top end variant, including a knee airbag weapon. Size is power. Power because you have choice. There's petrol, there's diesel, manual, automatic and all wheel drive as well. The one that we're driving right now is the 200 HP petrol. And this is one smooth customer. It's got good amount of grunt, which means whether you're planning overtakes, it just doesn't break a sweat. It gets going easily and smoothly. If you want to hustle it, the gearbox might feel a bit slow, but it is smooth. But you've got the grunt from the engine. To make up for the record, that's 318 Newton meters of torque. I wonder how quick will it be? But the bigger question is just how thirsty will it be? The heavier car returns about nine to 12 with the same engine, albeit in a lower state of tune. The diesel comes in two states of tune, 156 PS for the lower MX variant. But the one that we drove was the 185 PS version with the six speed manual gearbox. And this engine is really easy to use. It's got good talk right from low rev, so driving it around really isn't a hassle. There is one little bit that's a little bit clumsy, and that is the clutch. It's a really long travel clutch, but I'm guessing most people would want the automatic any which way. And to make this diesel engine more exciting, it gets drive modes. There's Zip, Zap, Zoom and Rajesh. Well, it's called custom, actually, but I'm calling it Rajesh because like the door handles, which were suggested by Anand Mahindra, the custom mode was suggested by the path of Mahindra Mahindra, which is Rajasthy Turikar. Sorry, sir, let's stick to the driving mode. The zip mode is basically for your calm commuting within the city when you use the Zap mode, the steering weighs up, responsiveness improves. So that's for when you're in a bit of a rush. And the zoom mode, as the name suggests, is when you're in a proper rush, preferably out on the highway, because that's when throttle responsiveness gets really sharp wheel spin coming out of corners if you're not careful. And all the modes also adjust the ESP, which kind of pushes the braking intervention that much further. And if you use the custom mode, that gives you one additional little bit of control, which is the settings for the air conditioning system. Weapon six versatility. That's down to the bones of the SUV, because this has a new chassis that is way stiffer than before. It's got upgraded suspension design and components. So you have FSD dampers, which are basically meant to tune out a lot of the roughness or the imperfections, and you have a multi link suspension at the rear. And what you get with that is a vehicle that you aren't fighting with anymore, because this just tackles road surfaces with so much more confidence. It doesn't get upset over bumps, it doesn't feel twitchy at higher speeds. This is a confident machine and something that you will enjoy spending time traveling with. When it comes to comfort, the XUV has got you covered because that suspension can soak up big bumps with ease. It just kind of glosses over all of that. And of course, if you're looking to go off road, there is a good amount of ground clearance on offer. But we don't have exact numbers right now. And talking about off road, the all wheel drive system will enable you to go further down the rough road if you choose to venture out. But it's an on demand system, so it's primarily improving stability and enabling some rough road ability rather than being an offroad oriented setup. But there are a few chinks in the SUV's armor. For instance, the cabin experience could have been better with better sound insulation. Right now, it's good enough to be acceptable, but not good enough to make you feel absolutely cocooned. And then there's the suspension setup, which is a bit on the soft side, especially at the rear. So every time you accelerate, you can feel the squatting of the rear. If the suspension were firmer, the XUV would feel flatter and improve its long legged ability to the nth degree. And then there is the fun quotient. When you think of 200 HP, it gets your blood racing, doesn't it? But the way it handles is neat. You wouldn't call this exactly fun. For that, it would need a bit more engagement from the steering wheel and, well, a little less understeer. But to its credit, the SUV does so in a very predictable and in a very gradual manner. So it's got a very safe air about it. There are other misses, too, like some design bits. Did you manage to miss out on this special door pad that rises up. Strange indeed. Apparently, it's because there needed to be Roommade for the switches for the powered seats. But honestly, sitting where I am, I can say that it doesn't bother me. It's no problem. Of course, the drive modes are only available on the diesel. But the real annoying bit is this drive mode button here does nothing more than call up the mode menu here on the screen. You have to actually reach out to the screen to change the modes, which really doesn't make sense in terms of quality. There are some bits which feel plastic, but they look fine, so you're willing to let them pass. But there are some bits like this, which you would end up using often as the driver and just feel a bit flimsy and kill the experience a little bit. There are some feature misses, basic ones. For instance, of the four power window switches here, it's only the driver switch, which has auto up and down, and the IRVM isn't auto dimming. And then there are the wow features. There is no ambient lighting and there are no ventilated seats on offer here in the backseat, there are no sound shades for these large windows and the second row doesn't slide. It's not unreal. So, yeah, it's interesting to see where Mahindra's cut back to save on costs, which is on some extra features. It was a good thing that Mahindra shared the price tag of the XUV Seven double before we drove it, because, as we've seen, it does have its shortcomings in the way it dries, it could be a bit more engaging in terms of the cabin experience, it could be a bit more punished. And in terms of the features list, it does have a few holes. But as is as this weightless, it comes across as a sensible, very usable and a very likable machine that is coming with some incredible segment first technology for safety. And coming in at the price point that Mahindra is indicating, the XUV Seven doubleo is going to have a final chink in its armor, which is going to demand a lot from you. And that is patience, because as likely as not, x UV Seven double O's waiting list is going to be long. Very long.
